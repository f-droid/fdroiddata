AutoName: M-Droid
Description: |-
  This is M-Droid, a drop-in replacement for the F-Droid client. It provides the same features but in a Material Design way that is both nice to see and easy to use.

  This project started because I hate the new F-Droid UI while still loving the actual software. And as I like React-Native, this is a good project for me.

  <b> Features</b>

  MDroid attempts to mimic F-Droid features as much as possible, in a Material design fashion. Here's a (not ordered) list of actual MDroid's features:

  * Clean UI following the Material Design specifications
  * Fetching multiple repositories
  * Curated main screen showing somes apps from each categories
  * View app's details
  * Download and install any app from repositories
  * Search for apps (fuzzy search, super fast)
  * Manage (add, edit, delete) your repositories

  <b> How it works</b>

  Basically you add your repositories of choice (along with the F-Droid, F-Droid Archive & Guardian ones) then the client will send some GET requests to actually get the content of the https://${repoBaseUrl}/index.xml file who's contains the repo.

  Then it parse that file by converting the XML to JSON format, for better code efficiency. Cache the parsed stuffs and display the informations in a great way for the user.
