AutoName: MatLog Libre
Description: |-
  Debug your apps. Find error stacktraces. See what your phone is saying about you
  behind your back. It's all there in the system log, aka logcat!

  MatLog shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "logcat" system log, hence
  the goofy name. It also allows you to record logs in real time, send logs via
  email, and filter using a variety of criteria.

  * Color-coded tag names
  * Easy-to-read column display
  * Real-time search
  * Recording mode (with widget)
  * Save & open from SD card
  * Send logs as email or attachment
  * Auto-scrolls when at the bottom of the screen
  * Search autosuggestions & saved filters
  * Select and save parts of logs
  * Open-source and ad-free
  * Material goodness
