AutoName: Event Sync for Facebook
Summary: Sync your Facebook Events into your calendar
Description: |-
    '''Event Sync for Facebook''' is an app that will sync your Facebook events to
    your calendar. It will create five new calendars:

    * Events I'm Attending - for events that you marked yourself that you are 'Going' on Facebook
    * Events I May Be Attending - for events that you marked yourself as 'Maybe' on Facebook
    * Events I Have Not Responded To - for events that you were invited to but did not respond yet
    * Events I Declined - for events that you marked yourself as 'Not Going' on Facebook
    * Friends' Birthdays - you no longer have an excuse to forget your friends' birthdays

    You can configure reminders for events in each of those calendars
    independently. You can also configure how often the events should be synced.

    Antifeatures:
    * Tracking and NonFreeNet - You are required to log in to Facebook
