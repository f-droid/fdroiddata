Auto Name:Sky Map
Summary:Sky Map to explore the skies
Description:
Point your phone at the sky, and Sky Map will show the stars, planets, constellations, and more to help
you identify the celestial objects in view. You can also browse the skies in manual mode.

The app may not be able to detect your location very well if you are not using the non-Free Network Location
service. It could be best to enter coordinates rather than entering a town or using GPS.

The app has been built without the non-free Google Analytics library.
