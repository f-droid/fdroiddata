AutoName: WhatsApp Twitch Stickers
Description: |-
  A sticker pack for WhatsApp comprising of Twitch emotes

  Includes over 50 emotes such as:

  * Kappa
  * monkaS
  * PogChamp
  * OMEGALUL
  * 4Head
  * LuL
  * TriHard

  Note: Certain devices reload the stickers each time WhatsApp is launched.
  Disabling battery optimization for the app fixes it.
