Description: |-
  Play <a href="http://www.spiel-tac.de/">TAC</a> on the go.

  <i>MoTAC</i> is a mobile board for the TAC board game. This app and your TAC cards
  is all you need to play TAC everywhere. Save and resume your game at any time.
  <i>MoTAC</i> is the best way for playing TAC while traveling.

  You can play with 1-4 players, because MoTAC allows any move possible on a real
  board. Counters are moved per drag-and-drop to any location on the board.
  However, basic rule checking is also included. Tap a counter for displaying all
  allowed moves, choose one to automatically make the move. MoTAC can only be
  played along with the TAC cards. It solely replaces board and marbles.
