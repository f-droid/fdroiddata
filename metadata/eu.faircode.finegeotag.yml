AutoName: FineGeotag
Description: |-
  <b>Note:</b> This app is no longer maintained.

  Automatically geotag photos with a real-time location right after they are
  taken. The camera application mostly uses the last known location, which could
  be old and miles away from your current position. FineGeotag will try to acquire
  an accurate location in real-time and update the Exif location tags of the
  photos taken. FineGeotag will try to use the GPS and/or the network location,
  depending on which location providers are enabled in the Android settings.
  Optionally a popup will be shown with a thumbnail of the photo and the reverse
  geocoded address. Don't forget to disable geotagging of your camera application
  to prevent interference.
