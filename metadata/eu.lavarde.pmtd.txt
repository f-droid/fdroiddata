Auto Name:PlusMinusTimesDivide
Summary:Train children in arithmetic
Description:
A program to train children's mathematical skills in the four calculation
methods: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
The preferences allow to adapt the app's difficulty to any pupil's level,
from basic primary (elementary) school to secondary and beyond.

The program gives hints when the given answer is wrong (send upstream your tips if
you have some more). The preferences dialog (from the Menu button) allows
adaptation to most levels of difficulty required by children in different ages:
maximum of operands or result, integer or decimal (with up to four decimal
places) operations, with or without carry over, multiplication and addition
tables training, number of authorized tries, and some few others...

There is a timer but it is shut-off by default, as to not stress sensible
children. Finally, the language of the app can be set differently (English,
French, German) from the system default.
