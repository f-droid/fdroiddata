Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> The developer is currently on hiatus from the project. Questions and pull requests may not be looked at for some time.

  Protect Baby Monitor allows two Android devices to act as a baby monitor. The
  first device, left in the room with the baby, will advertise itself on the
  network and stream audio to a connected client. The second device, with the
  parent, will connect to the monitoring device and receive an audio stream.
