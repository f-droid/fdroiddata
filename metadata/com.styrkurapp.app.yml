Description: |-
  Styrkur is an easy to use, yet powerful tool to track your workout. Set up your
  own workout plan or use one of our predefined.

  There should not be a big step from writing your sets on a piece of paper to
  using an app. You will get a simple view of what you should do and how much you
  did the last time. With a built in timer you have full control over both your
  sets and your pauses.

  You get simple ways of keeping track of your progress. Styrkur offers both an
  simple list of your past sessions with your comments, and graphical view of your
  progress.

  Track your measurements, weight and muscle gain with a simple and charts.
