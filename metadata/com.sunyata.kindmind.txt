Auto Name:KindMind
Summary:Be aware of sad feelings and unmet needs
Description:
Mindfulness and self-compassion tracker which brings awareness to painful
feelings and the unmet needs causing these feelings. It can also be customized
to suggest kind actions that can be taken after the feelings and need have been
identified, and these actions can optionally be connected to various media. The
app contains a sorting algorithm which puts the most relevant list items
highest, taking into account relationships between list items that the user has
chosen together so that the sorting improves as the app is used.
