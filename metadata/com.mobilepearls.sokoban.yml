AutoName: Sokoban
Description: |-
  Push the jewels in to the green zones, but don't corner yourself!

  Sokoban is a fun and challenging puzzle game where you have to push red diamonds
  onto green targets without getting stuck.

  As diamonds cannot be pulled, only pushed one at a time, it's all too easy to
  get stuck and frustrated - but keep going and do not despair!

  * Enjoy hundreds of puzzling levels all challenging your brain muscles.
  * Totally free without in app purchases.
  * Compete against your friends in who can solve a particular level first.
  * Undo moves using the back button.
  * Pinch to zoom for an overview of large levels.

  This game features graphics and game data from the computer game KSokoban by
  Anders Widell and is released under the GPLv2 license.
