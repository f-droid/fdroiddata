AutoName: GnuPrivacyGuard
Summary: GnuPG via gpgcli
Description: |-
  GnuPrivacyGuard extends the gpgcli command line tool to bring an integrated
  privacy engine to your Android. It gives you command line access to the entire
  GnuPG suite of encryption software. It also serves as the test bed for complete
  Android integration for all of GnuPG's crypto services, including OpenPGP,
  symmetric encryption, and more.

  GPG is GNU's tool for end-to-end secure communication and encrypted data
  storage. This trusted protocol is the free software alternative to PGP. This app
  is built upon GnuPG 2.1, the new modularized version of GnuPG that now supports
  S/MIME.

  GPG aims to provide an integrated experience, so clicking on PGP files should
  "just work". You can also share files to GPG to encrypt them. GPG will also
  respond when you click on a PGP fingerprint URL (one that starts with
  openpgp4fpr:).

  Before using GPG, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its installation
  process. Once it has completed, then you're ready to use it. The easiest way to
  get started with GPG is to install https://f-droid.org/packages/jackpal.androidterm. GPG will
  automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as long as you have the "Allow
  PATH extensions" settings enabled.
