AutoName: Simple Cleanup
Description: |-
  Extremely simple cleanup app! Doesn't need internet, one button solution!

  <i>Simple Cleanup</i> deletes files according to the space needed in your phone.

  * At 20% space free, it deletes old WhatsApp backups and Tencent cache, in that order, until it gets to >20%.
  * At 10% space free it deletes the last WhatsApp backup, old media (> 1 mo. old) and then all media, in that order.

  <i>Simple Cleanup</i> checks file by file until enough space would be free.

  <i>Simple Cleanup</i> checks in the background and alerts you if you are
  running low on free space.

  Note: currently only WhatsApp folders are checked. More might be added in
  the future.

  <i>Simple Cleanup</i> is always accepting recommendations and adding features!
