Description: |-
    Automatically turns on the loud speaker if the hardware keyboard is opened
    during a call and turns it off if its being closed. Optionally autoanswer and/or
    autohangup the same way.

    This app is only interesting for users with a slideable physical hardware
    keyboard.

    The app idea comes from the HTC Wings aka S730.
