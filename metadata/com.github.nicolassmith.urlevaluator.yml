AutoName: Short URL Evaluator
Description: |-
  <i>Short URL Evaluator</i> lengthens shortened URLs for correct handling in
  Android.

  This app is designed to be a short-URL unshortener. Android sometimes
  launches an app if it recognizes the URL, for example, a link to
  maps.google.com will open in the Maps app. However, this does not work for
  short URLs, they will open in a browser, and many browsers will then just
  open the mobile web site corresponding to the link.

  This app will take the short url, unshorten it, and give it back so that
  android can launch the correct application.

  Over 350 URL-shortening services are supported!
