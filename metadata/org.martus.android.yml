Summary: secure documentation for human rights defenders, activists & journalists
Description: |-
    <b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: Before running Mobile Martus, you (or someone you
    designate) must have a Martus desktop client account set up on a computer to
    receive your Mobile Martus data, and you will need that account info to
    configure Mobile Martus.  If you do not already have it, you can download the
    Martus desktop client and follow the installation instructions in the Reference
    Guide at https://www.martus.org.

    Mobile Martus is a secure, Android-based mobile documentation application built
    on Benetech’s Martus technology, which allows human rights defenders, activists,
    journalists, and other users anywhere in the world to securely gather
    information about human rights violations.

    The Mobile Martus application allows users to send crucial data from the
    field—text, photographs, audio and video—to the Martus network of secure
    servers. The data is automatically encrypted on the mobile device, and when
    being sent to the server, so it is protected in case the device is lost, stolen
    or confiscated. A user—or someone they designate—can later retrieve their data,
    and can search, analyze and report on the information, using the Martus desktop
    client software (https://www.martus.org) on their computer.
