AutoName: Chromium SWE Updater
Description: |-
  Note: App is no longer developed

  Automatically update an unofficial build of
  <a href="https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/all-active-projects/chromium-browser-snapdragon
  Code">Aurora's Chromium for Snapdragon</a>, an optimized fork targeting Qualcomm's
  Snapdragon processors.

  The custom build aims to deploy the stock Chromium SWE with only few additions:
  custom icon, custom name, adblock, more search engines.

  This app will search a third-party GitHub repo
  <a href="https://github.com/bamless/chromium-swe-builds">https://github.com/bamless/chromium-swe-builds</a> for new custom builds once a
  day, and will show a notification if one is found.
