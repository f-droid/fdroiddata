AutoName: Chromium SWE Updater
Summary: Update custom Chromium for Snapdragon builds
Description: |-
    Automatically update an unofficial build of
    [https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/all-active-projects/chromium-browser-snapdragon
    Code Aurora's Chromium for Snapdragon], an optimized fork targeting Qualcomm's
    Snapdragon processors.

    The custom build aims to deploy the stock Chromium SWE with only few additions:
    custom icon, custom name, adblock, more search engines.

    This app will search a third-party GitHub repo
    [https://github.com/bamless/chromium-swe-builds] for new custom builds once a
    day, and will show a notification if one is found.
