AutoName: SnooperStopper
Description: |-
  Allows you to create a different encryption password for booting your device
  than unlocking your screen. This allows you to have a stronger device encryption
  password (which you only need to enter once after booting your device) and a
  simpler pattern/PIN/password for unlocking your screen.

  If an attacker tries to guess your simple pattern/PIN/password, he has only few
  tries (default is 3) after which the device is rebooted and he needs to enter
  your strong device encryption password again.

  Root privileges required.
