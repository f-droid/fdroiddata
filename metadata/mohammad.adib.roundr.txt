Summary:Round the corners of the screen
Description:
RoundR takes advantage of the fact that regardless of the device's color, the 
screen is surrounded with a pitch black border, the corners of which are 
rarely ever touched. RoundR places four small overlays at the corners of the 
display, to simulate a rounded screen.
