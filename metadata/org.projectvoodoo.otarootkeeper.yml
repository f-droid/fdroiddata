Description: |-
  <b>Does not work for Android 4.3 updates</b>

  This application makes a backup or a protected backup of your device's root.

  root devices. If several conditions are matched, OTA RootKeeper will make root
  survive OTAs, and anything else except /system partition formatting.

  Requirement:

  * /system partition as Ext2, Ext3 or Ext4
  * Upgrades not formatting or overwriting completely the /system partition.
  * See website for info about devices that meet these requirements

  Require root: Yes.
