AutoName: TopoSuite
Description: |-
  TopoSuite for Android is an application that targets land surveyors by helping
  them determining new geographical points based on measurements and offering some
  utilities. It is able to do the following calculations:

  Polar calculations:

  * station orientation
  * free station
  * polar survey
  * polar implantation
  * axis implantation

  Orthogonal calculations:

  * orthogonal survey
  * orthogonal tracking
  * orthogonal implantation

  Intersections calculations:

  * lines intersections
  * circles intersections
  * line / circle intersections

  Surface calculations:

  * surface included with arc of a circle
  * parallel limit displacement regarding compulsory surface

  Miscellaneous:

  * field / distance
  * point projection on a line
  * circle computation using three points
  * arc of a circle segmentation

  Mathematics:

  * triangle solver
  * circular elements resolution

  Data, such as points, can be imported into the application from CSV, LTOP or PTP
  file formats and exported to CSV. The history of all the calculations, the
  points and application settings can be exported to file (*.tpst) which can be
  imported into other instances of the application or simply later on.
