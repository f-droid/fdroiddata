Summary:Remote control
Description:
Gmote turns Android into a remote control for a computer, allowing users to run 
movies and music at a distance. 
It supports all of the standard remote control features such as play, pause, 
rewind, volume controls etc. 
It also has a built-in file browser that lets you select what to play. 
Some typical use-cases
are people launching and controlling movies while sitting back on their couch, 
or listening to music.

It also has a touch pad feature which allows you to control your mouse from 
the phone, similar to a laptop
touchpad (also sending keystrokes typed in on the phone to the computer). 
It's great for sitting back on
the couch while watching youtube or hulu.

Status: Version 2.0.7 elsewhere exists but there isn't any source
.
