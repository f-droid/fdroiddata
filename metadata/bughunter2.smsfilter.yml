AutoName: SMS Filter
Description: |-
  SMS Filter can filter incoming SMS messages before they reach your inbox. You
  can filter by address, and optionally add parts that must occur in the message
  for it to be blocked.

  By default, SMS Filter will not delete incoming messages. You will get a silent
  status bar notification when SMS Filter has filtered an incoming message, which
  you can view by opening the notification or by opening the application.

  You can also tell SMS Filter to delete incoming messages, in which case it will
  happily do so for you. To do this, just turn off the 'Save messages' preference.
