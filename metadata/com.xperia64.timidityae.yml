AutoName: Timidity AE
Description: |-
  Multimedia player focused on playing MIDI files. Instead of built-in Android
  MIDI playing features, it uses Timidity++ engine and allows specifying
  soundfonts and options. Included soundfont 8Rock11e seems to have non-free
  license "Distribute freely. Don't disassemble."

  Features include:

  * High quality MIDI file playback far superior to Android's built in Synth
  * Support for multiple user-set SoundFonts or patch sets
  * Multi-track mixer with support for per-track instrument and volume adjustment (only available for MIDI and MOD files)
  * Tempo, pitch, voice, and resampling controls
  * Create, save, and load custom instrument and volume configurations
  * Additional support for Amiga MOD files as well as the formats Android natively supports (mp3, ogg, flac, etc)
  * Export MIDI or MOD files to wav
  * Compressed .sfArk and .sfArk.exe SoundFont extraction
  * Notification with playback buttons (Honeycomb or later)
  * Folder and playlist based music organization
  * Dark and light themes
