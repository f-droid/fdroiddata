Auto Name:Primary
Summary:A simple educational practice game for kids (and adults).
Description:
Primary is a slightly gamified educational application aimed at Primary
(Elementary) school-aged children, but of course adults who wish to sharpen
their skills will find it useful as well.  There are levels dealing with basic
math, sorting, clocks, spelling, plurals, etc., with new subjects planned for
the future.

See the website for a full list of subjects and features.
