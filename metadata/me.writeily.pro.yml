MaintainerNotes: |-
  Builds locally, but might break on BS. We need to integrate ndkbuild and gradle
  task into overall build, e.g. with preassemble=libs:anddown:packageNativeLibs
  instead of using `build=`. However, right now this breaks the app because the
  native libs don't seem to get included.
