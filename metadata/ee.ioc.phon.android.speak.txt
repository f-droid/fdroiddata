Auto Name:Kõnele
Summary:Speech-to-text provider
Description:
Offers speech-to-text service to other apps. Apps which allow user input via
voice usually have a little microphone button as part of their user interface.
It is a free replacement for the proprietary Google voice search, based on
the [http://bark.phon.ioc.ee/speech-api/v1/ Net Speech API] to communicate
with a speech recognition server. Currently only estonian is supported by
the pre-confgured server.

The makeIcons and makeDiagrams tasks don't provide `cleaning`, hence we cannot
