Auto Name:WebApps
Summary:Sandbox for webapps
Description:
Provide a secure way to browse popular webapps by eliminating referrers, 3rd
party requests, cookies, cross-site scripting, etc.

It accomplishes this by providing a sandbox for multiple webapps (like Google's
apps, Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Each webapp will run in it's own sandbox, with
3rd party requests (images, scripts, iframes, etc.) blocked, and all external
links opening in an external default web browser (which should have cookies,
plugins, flash, etc. disabled).

By default, all HTTP requests are blocked (only HTTPS allowed). This improves
security, especially on untrusted networks. The app can also handle HTTPS links
and open them in their own sandbox.
