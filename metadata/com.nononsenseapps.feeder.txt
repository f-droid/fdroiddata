Summary:A no-nonsense RSS/Atom feed reader app
Description:
This is a no-nonsense RSS/Atom feed reader app for Android.

One of its primary features is that it parses HTML it finds in feeds and
displays it as regular text. No ridiculous web-views here. But still, images are
rendered in-line and links are clickable for example.

Features:

* Parses HTML into text
* Offline reading
* Local storage
* Background synchronization
* Notification support
* OPML Import/Export
* Gives access to enclosure links
* Material design
.
