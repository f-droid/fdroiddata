AutoName: WiFi Manager
Description: |-
  Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager helps you automatically turning on/off your
  Wi-Fi while you are not near a known WiFi network. The app keeps track of
  the cell tower ids in your area while you are connected to a WiFi network.
  By keeping this information, the app tries to learn where your WiFi is
  located without using GPS.

  By switching off the device's WiFi when it is not required, so-called
  tracking via WiFi is avoided. Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager also saves
  battery life by automatically disabling your device's WiFi in case it is
  not near an already known WiFi network.

  The app preserves your privacy by tracking least necessary data. All data
  is kept on your phone. No data is sent to anybody. We also try to use the
  least permissions possible. Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager requires access
  the the device's coarse location to retrieve the cell tower information. It
  furthermore requires access to the WiFi state and the permission to change
  the WiFi state.

  The app belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the
  research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
