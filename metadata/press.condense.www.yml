Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> Website is no longer online

  News apps like Google News, Flipboard, BBC show trending articles written
  a day or two back. If say there are hundred articles written in a day, these news
  apps pick just a few of them. It is a time saving feature. But they lack a key
  flexibility.
  Consider you haven't read any news for the last 1 monthor 1 year.
  If you open any of the news apps or news websites, you will still be shown trending
  articles written a day or two back and not last month or last year. Hence this
  app https://f-droid.org/packages/press.condense.www picks popular articles of a website in a time range
  we specify.
  For example, techcrunch.com has 292,172 articles. But this app sorts
  all those articles based on popularity. This app is a a webview of [www.condense.press]
  and has PWA(Progressive Web App) features.
