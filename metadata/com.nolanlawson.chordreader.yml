Description: |-
  ChordReader is an app that fetches chord charts and tabulatures for your
  favorite songs from the Internet, saves them, and displays them in an
  easy-to-read format with the chords highlighted. The identified chords can also
  be transposed up or down, or you can add a capo. It's good for changing the key
  of a song to fit your vocal range.

  Doesn't work on tablets running android 4+ , but works for phones
