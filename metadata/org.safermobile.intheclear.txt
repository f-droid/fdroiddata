Auto Name:InTheClear
Summary:Alerting and secure wipe
Description:
InTheClear is a suite of mobile applications designed to keep users safer in
difficult situations by using their phone's built-in tools. At its core are two
main features: Emergency SMS and Data Wipe. At installation, InTheClear walks a
new user through the process of configuring each of these features. The user can
then activate either Emergency SMS or Data Wipe individually, on an ad-hoc
basis. In addition, they can simultaneously activate *both* Emergency SMS and
Data Wipe via Panic!, a simple, one-touch feature of InTheClear.
