This application will not run on devices with less than 1 GB of RAM.

Click the camera button or load an image from the image gallery to analyze a
single picture. Tap the display to close the displayed result, or use the share
button to share a screenshot. Activate continuous predictions and keep the dog
in the circle to get predictions directly from the video stream.

The application reports up to three predictions it believes to be the most
correct. Please treat the output only as a suggestion.
