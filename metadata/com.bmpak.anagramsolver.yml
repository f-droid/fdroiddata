AutoName: Anagram Solver
Description: |-
  Find anagrams for any given word INSTANTLY!

  A word or phrase formed by reordering the letters of another word or phrase,
  such as "garden" to "danger", is called an anagram. One word anagrams (where a
  single word is anagrammed into another single word) are sometimes referred to by
  wordplay specialists as transpositions. For example, "listen" is a transposition
  of "silent".

  You can type a regular or a scrambled word and see all the possible
  combinations. Come up with a word and let the app find all the possible
  anagrams. Browsing through random anagrams is a fun option! You can also use the
  app as a spelling dictionary.
