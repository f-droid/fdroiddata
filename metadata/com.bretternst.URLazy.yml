AutoName: URLazy
Description: |-
  Eases the pain of entering long URLs into a bunch of test devices by finding
  collections of URLs on the local network and allowing you to open them with a
  single tap. You can serve links from a GUI app on your workstation or from a
  Ruby script on a local development server (source code in same repo).

  URLazy finds this list with no configuration required, provided you are
  connected to your network via Wi-Fi. This makes it super easy to test your
  projects on real devices without manually setting up bookmarks or entering URLs.

  This is a better alternative to bookmarks or centralized index pages because new
  devices require no set-up and you don't have to edit URLs every time your
  environment changes - or if you take your work home. URLazy uses multicast UDP
  to find collections of links. If your network administrator enables it, this can
  even work across a corporate WAN.
