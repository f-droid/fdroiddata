Auto Name:Inetify
Summary:WiFi Internet access helper
Description:
Inetify is an Android tool providing two features related to Wifi networks:
1.Give a notification if a Wifi network does not provide internet access.
2.Automatically activate Wifi when near a Wifi network and deactivate it
otherwise: this is
experimental and will use GPS when necessary, thus draining the battery

'''N.B''' It isn't possible to view your position on a map because Google Maps
is the only map source and
f-droid can't supply an API key to use it. If you need to use Google Maps
install the developer's build from the website.	

Anti-feature: Dependencies. It's necessary for Google Maps to be already
installed either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be
installable. We will be able to remove this dependency soon.
