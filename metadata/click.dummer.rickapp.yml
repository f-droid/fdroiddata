AutoName: Rick App
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

  The Rick-App plays a automatic burp in silent situations. This App makes it
  possible to talk like Rick in <i>Rick and Morty</i>.

  Features:

  * Threshold ruler: modify the noise limit
  * RickApp plays a burp sound, if there is a realy short time without noise
  * It plays a new burp only after 2 seconds to protect from endless burps
  * If your mobile plays sound, RickApp <i>hears</i> it, too.
  * RickApp shows the sound sampling values in a textbox

  Your Screen is off, but RickApp does not sleep! Use the <i>recent App</i> feature
  of your Homescreen and close RickApp by swiping it away.

  <b>This App uses the microphone! You can not use the microphone, if you get a
  call and RickApp works!</b>
