Name: FASTer App Search Tool
AutoName: FAST App Search Tool
Description: |-
  Find your apps without needing to scroll through lists. It can display icons or
  not and search for package names too if the option is selected. Long-pressing an
  entry can display options to view the App Details, which is helpful for
  uninstalling apps, or to view the app on Google Play. Works as a normal app or a
  launcher. This is the smaller variant (no translations and extras) - if you do
  not care that much for space you might want to install FAST.
