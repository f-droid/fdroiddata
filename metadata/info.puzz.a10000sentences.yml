AutoName: 10,000 sentences
Description: |-
  <i>10,000 sentences</i> is an app that will help you learn new words in your
  target languages: You will be presented with a series of sentences where
  you need to guess the order of words. If your guess is correct, the app
  will find a new (and slightly more complex) sentence.

  The application currently has 24 languages. Each language is available in
  two "directions". For example "French for English speakers" and "English
  for French speakers". More languages will be added in future. If you want
  to check the translations for words, make sure you have Google Translate
  installed.

  The application uses "text-to-speach" (TTS), but not all languages are
  available on all Android phones. Some languages have also commercial TTS
  engines available on Google Play.
