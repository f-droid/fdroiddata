Auto Name:Rehearsal Assistant
Summary:A voice/sound recording tool
Description:
A voice / sound recording utility with two modes of operation:

Session Mode: organizes recordings into sessions, and time-stamps relative to
the beginning of the session, making it useful for recording your thoughts and
observations during an event.

If you are a choreographer or director watching a rehearsal of your work, this
can help you make note of the feedback you want to share with the cast.

Simple Mode: easy recording and playback of sound files. If you are a musician
or writer, it can help you record and remember your spontaneous moments of
inspiration.

Also works great for shopping lists and other kinds of reminders.
