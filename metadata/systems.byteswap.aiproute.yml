AutoName: AIProute
Description: |-
  This app allows you to add specific IP routes on Android to route the IP
  traffic. It is possible to set address, netmask, gateway and metric. Due to the
  nature of the "ip route" command, root access is necessary. It is possible to
  apply routes based on the active SSID, to ensure the route is only applied in
  the correct Wifi network. If it is set, the routes are applied during the
  Android boot.
