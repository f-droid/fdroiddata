Summary:Text-to-Speech over network
Description:
NetTTS allows to use Android device as remote-controlled
Text-to-Speech server from other computers, via simple
telnet-like network protocol. A TTS engine must be installed
on your device. To try:

telnet <IP address of device> 4444

type "Hello".

Note that currently app provides minimal means of access control
(optional plain-text password), so use outside your local network
with caution.
