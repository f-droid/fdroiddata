Auto Name:Batch Uninstaller
Summary:Uninstall multiple applications at once
Description:
Batch Uninstaller allows you to uninstall multiple apps at once. If root
permission is not available, you can still delete multiple apps a lot quicker
than you can using the native android implementation. However, you will be
prompted for each app uninstalled. Non Root users can not uninstall system apps.
This is a limitation with the Android Operating system.
