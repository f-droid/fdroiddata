Summary:A classic puzzle game with custom images
Description:
n-Puzzle app is a classic sliding puzzle game based on the Fifteen Puzzle. It allows you to
choose among three levels of complexity: 3×3 (8-puzzle), 4×4 (15-puzzle), and 5×5
(24-puzzle), hence the name.

In addition to standard square boards with numbers, you can choose a board with a picture
painted on it. There are three stock pictures installed with the puzzle, and you can add your
own pictures by pressing Menu button when the picture selection page is displayed. The
picture you select will be split into equal tiles.

Once you select the picture, the solved puzzle is displayed for 3 seconds. Then it is
randomly shuffled, and you have to move the tiles to their initial locations. When you solve
the puzzle, the app will display that picture again along with the number of moves you have
made.

To change the puzzle’s settings during the game, press Menu button. Note that when you change
any settings, the game starts over. When you switch apps or exit during the game, your puzzle
is stored and resumed next time you run n-Puzzle.
