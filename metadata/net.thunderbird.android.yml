MaintainerNotes: |-
  Thunderbird for Android is based on K-9 Mail. The source repository contains both applications, a
  symlink points to the correct metadata path. We're using the `foss` flavor for submission to
  f-droid, while the `full` flavor will be reserved for the Play Store.

  Thunderbird on the Play Store has two separate application ids and listings. This listing is the
  release targeted at the majority of our users.

  The source code may have a few pointers to potentially unwanted features. There is the Play Store
  billing library, which we're going to use to collect financial contributions in the Play Store
  flavor. The f-droid variant simply links out to our fundraising page in a web browser. There is
  also Glean telemetry, which is currently disabled. When we re-enable it, we expect it will meet
  the opt-in requirements set in the policies.

  Auto updates are currently disabled and will be done manually. We strive to enable auto updates
  soon after the release. We'll also switch to tags instead of the commit once the tagging is done.
