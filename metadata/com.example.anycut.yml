AutoName: Any Cut
Description: |-
  You can make shortcuts for anything that has an activity e.g Android keyboard
  settings screen. All activities are listed but there is no description of what
  each does, so you'll just have to take a guess and some may not do anything. In
  addition you can make shortcuts to directly dial or send an sms to a contact.

  This app is ancient so it may not work on Android 4+ but you can get direct
  access to app activities with https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ideasfrombrain.search_based_launcher_v2.
