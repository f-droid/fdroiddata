AutoName: Video Transcoder
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is currently looking for a volunteer to take over development. If you are interested, please reach out.

  Do you want to encode videos on your phone into different formats, trim videos,
  or extract audio? Are you looking for a free solution which will not take your
  information?

  Video Transcoder is an application which uses the open source program FFmpeg to
  transcode video files from one format to another. By selecting the video to
  process, details for the video are provided and the desired settings can be
  configured.

  The application requires very few permissions, and never attempts to access the
  Internet.
