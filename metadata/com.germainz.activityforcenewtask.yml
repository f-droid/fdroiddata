AutoName: ActivityForceNewTask
Description: "Apps can launch other apps' activities inside their task. This makes\
    \ it impossible to switch back and forth between the two. This Xposed module sets\
    \ the FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag when starting a new activity, which 'fixes'\
    \ that (note to devs: only startActivity is hooked for obvious reasons.) Note\
    \ that this module may break things."
