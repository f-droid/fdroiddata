  A proprietary analytics library was removed before building.

  The app makes use of an <a href="http://dev.npr.org">API</a> and you should observe the
  <a href="http://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use">terms</a> if you are
  considering making a derivative — in particular, only non-commercial use is
  allowed.

  Status: There isn't any source for the current version so we built from the
  latest available. Bugs are included, especially to do with the location aspect
  so you might want to disable GPS while using.
