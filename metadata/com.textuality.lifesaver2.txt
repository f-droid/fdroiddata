Auto Name:LifeSaver2
Summary:SMS and call log backup/restore
Description:
A simple way to transfer your SMS and call logs to another phone via the sdcard.
We don't have version 2.0 which can transfer the data via a Google App Engine
server as it would require tokens that aren't in the source code and the source
code for the server isn't free anyway.
