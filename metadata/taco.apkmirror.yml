AutoName: APKMirror
Summary: An unofficial APKMirror client/web app
Description: |-
    An app to browse APKMirror from a device from an app that browses APKMirror
    and only APKMirror as APKMirror only has apks (which are only used for
    Android devices), and is the sole purpose of this app existing (because who
    uses browsers amirite), so it only browses APKMirror, as an app.

    Features

    * Quick loading (for the most part)
    * Choose any download manager
    * Clean material design (I think)
    * Small-ish APK size

    Things that constitute as Anti-Features

    * The app itself does NOT contain any ads whatsoever. However, as anyone who has visited the APKMirror site probably knows, they do display ads. As this app utilizes WebView, the site's ads will also end up being displayed in the app.
