AutoName: CatLog
Description: |-
  CatLog shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "Logcat" system log, hence
  the goofy name. It also allows you to record logs in real time, send logs via
  email, and filter using a variety of criteria. It has a widget, can record logs
  in the background and has useful colour coding.

  It won't work on Android 4.1+ without root access, since apps are not allowed to
  access each others' logs.
