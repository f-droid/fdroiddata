Summary:Port Knocker
Description:
Michael Rash's Perl-based "fwknop" program: firewall knock operator. Implements
an authorization scheme called Single Packet Authorization (SPA). This method of
authorization is based around a default-drop packet filter (fwknop supports
iptables on Linux, ipfw on FreeBSD and Mac OS X, and PF on OpenBSD) and libpcap.
