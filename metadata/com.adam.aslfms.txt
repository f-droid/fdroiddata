Summary:Last.fm/Libre.fm Scrobbler
Description:
Scrobbling means submitting listening information to Last.fm and/or Libre.fm;
you can then get music recommendations and view your listening history and
statistics. The media player that you use must be able to work with the API
e.g. [[org.kreed.vanilla]] or [[jp.co.kayo.android.localplayer]]. Apps can
also hook into the Now-Playing broadcast: for example, [[com.jlyr]] can use it
to grab lyrics.

More info about scrobbling can be found on
