Description: |-
  This is a generic kernel configuration app which is primarily designed for Siyah
  kernel on s2 and s3. It can also be used on other kernels which supports the
  /res/uci.sh interface. This app has no service or any background execution; it
  generates a dynamic UI using the config xml provided by "/res/uci.sh config"
  command and calls the actions defined by the same xml upon user actions.

  The same application can be used to configure different kernels if the kernel
  has support for the interface. An example implementation can be found on the
  author's source code site in the <a href="https://github.com/gokhanmoral/initramfs3">
  initramfs of Siyah Kernel</a> for S2.
