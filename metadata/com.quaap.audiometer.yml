AutoName: AudioMeter
Summary: A simple VU-style audio meter
Description: |-
    A simple VU-style audio meter.  You can choose from several formulas to allow
    the meter to work in low- and high-noise level enviromnents.

    I noticed there was no audio meter in F-Droid, so I thought I'd build one.

    The app offers a few ways to calculate the audio level to display:

    * dBFS: Decibels relative to Full Scale.
    * RMS: Root Mean Square. This is arguable the most correct, but it is a little insensitive at low volumes.
    * LogRMS: Natural log of RMS: My first attempt to even out the scale. It's a little too sensitive to noisy mics.
    * SqrtRMS: Squareroot of RMS: My second attempt to even out RMS: it seems to works best.
    * Max: Simply find the loudest bit of each sample. Most responsive, but will peg the scale on noisey places.
    * Avg: Simple average of the sound.
