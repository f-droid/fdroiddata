Auto Name:Tasks
Summary:Keep track of your list of goals
Description:
A simple task manager app, allowing you to categorise your todo list by
urgency, state, timeframe etc.
It is supposed to synchronise to a CalDAV server but this only works via
the author's proprietary app.
There isn't an option to export the data: therefore you must archive 
/data/app/org.dmfs.tasks as root; or use adb backup if you are on Android 4.

Anti-feature: Non-free addons. Your data can't be synchronised or exported 
unless you install another, proprietary app.

Status: Beta.
