A proprietary analytics library was removed before building.

The app makes use of an [http://dev.npr.org API] and you should 
observe the [http://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use terms] 
if you are considering making a derivative — in particular, only non-commercial 
use is allowed.

Status: There isn't any source for the current version so we built from the 
latest available. Bugs are included, especially to do with the location aspect
so you might want to disable GPS while using.
