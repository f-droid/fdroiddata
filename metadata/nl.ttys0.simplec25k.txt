Auto Name:Simple C25K
Summary:Fitness trainer
Description:
Follow Josh Clark’s famous ‘Couch to 5k’ running plan. There is a plan for each
day and after every interval the phone will vibrate and beep to let you know if
you have to start or stop running. The application can run entirely in the
background so playing music during the exercise will not be a problem.
