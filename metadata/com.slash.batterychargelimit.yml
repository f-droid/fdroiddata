AutoName: Battery Charge Limit
Description: |-
  Change the limit up to which it should charge (default: 80). Check which control
  file suits best for your device,
  <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/root-battery-charge-limit-t3557002">
  see Q/A for hints</a>. In most cases, the pre-selected choice should be the best
  that's available for your device. The app only gets kicked in while you connect
  a charger (or USB), and automatically closes shortly after unplugging charger
  (or USB), i.e. it only runs in the background as long as it is plugged in, and
  won't affect your battery life. If your device is not charging even after
  disabling the limit (which shouldn't happen, just in case), uninstall the app
  and reboot the device (the changes made by the app don't survive a reboot). Your
  device should charge normally then.
