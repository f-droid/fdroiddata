Auto Name:Crosswords
Summary:A Scrabble-like game
Description:
A cross-platform game with the same rules as Scrabble that can be
played locally (on the same device), via SMS or via an internet relay.
Invite other people to a game by sending them a message (or
enter the name of the room if you already know it).
Drag letters onto the board next to other letters to make new words;
press the number on the right of the screen to commit your move and
let the next person move. English wordlist is included but there
is a link to the website to download other languages.

The source code supports push messaging via Google Play, but that
won't function in this build even if Google Play is installed.
It just means that moves wouldn't be as fast as if it were supported.
