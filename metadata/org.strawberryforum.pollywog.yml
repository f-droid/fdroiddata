Description: |-
    Just a minimal utilities menu for the LeapFrog Epic, the purpose being to unlock
    a number of hidden yet useful options that were present in vanilla AOSP but
    disabled in the Epic's firmware by LeapFrog for some reason. Think of it as like
    a watered down ROM Toolbox of sorts, but tailor-made for LeapFrog's Android
    tablet.
