Auto Name:Rick App
Summary:play automatic burp in silent situations
Description:
The Rick-App plays a automatic burp in silent situations. This App makes it
possible to talk like Rick in ''Rick and Morty''.

Features:

* Threshold ruler: modify the noise limit
* RickApp plays a burp sound, if there is a realy short time without noise
* It plays a new burp only after 2 seconds to protect from endless burps
* If your mobile plays sound, RickApp ''hears'' it, too.
* RickApp shows the sound sampling values in a textbox

Your Screen is off, but RickApp does not sleep! Use the ''recent App'' feature
of your Homescreen and close RickApp by swiping it away.

<b>This App uses the microphone! You can not use the microphone, if you get a
call and RickApp works!</b>
