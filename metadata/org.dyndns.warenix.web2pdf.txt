Description:
Web2PDF is the android way to use http://www.pdfmyurl.com/ for converting web
pages to pdf files. It lets you convert a web page to pdf file by using the
unique "share" feature of android platform. Unfortunately websites requiring you
to login are not supported.

For Gingerbread or newer devices, system download manager will be used to
download the pdf file. Otherwise for older devices, once pdf conversion is
