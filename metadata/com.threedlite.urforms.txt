Summary:Data entry tool
Description:
* Create a custom database and data entry screens with dropdowns, date choosers, and validation.
* Enter and store your custom data on device.
* List and search functionality for your fields.
* Stores data in local SQLite tables.
* Backup/restore data and forms to .csv files on SD Card.

How to use:
Add a new form by selecting "Manage Forms" from the menu in the upper right. (A couple example forms
are provided). Add fields to the form. Fields are text unless you change the data type to for example
Checkbox, Date, or Choices. For Choices, you can enter a list of comma separated values in the Choices
entry field. These will be presented in a drop down on the form. You can optionally set the field to be
required and add a validation regex which is a field format. Save the changes and then select Search / Enter
data from the menu. Select the form type from the list on the left. You can add a new entry or search
existing entries using the criteria fields below the search button. From the search screen you can
edit the entries.

For Advanced users --

Reference field types: One form field can point to a record in another form. In Form Manager, set a new
field to "reference" data type, and enter the "referenced form name". Then on the other referenced form,
check the "short desc" box on one or more fields. When entering data it will show a select button to
select a record from the other form data. This allows a foreign key type of relationship.

ReferencedBy type. The purpose of this field is to display a list of items that reference the current form.
For example a list of people attending a meeting.

The "Form Name Field Name" should be the name of the form that references this form, followed by a space,
and then the name of the field on the other form that references this form. The sample data created on
a new install has an example of a many-to-many relationship that can be created in this way.
