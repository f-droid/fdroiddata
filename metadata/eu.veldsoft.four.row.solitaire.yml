Description: |-
    Solitaire-like card game which is customizable with different sets, backgrounds
    and difficulties. All moves can be undone and hints can be invoked if you are
    stuck. It supports 1 or 3 card draw and featres statistics and a scoreboard. The
    sessions are saved, even when you exit the app. Comparison to other games:

    Similarities to FreeCell:

    * The Cards in the columns are always visible
    * There are four individual cells at the top

    Similarities to Solitaire:

    * There is a deck and discard pile to draw cards from
    * Only Kings may be placed at the top of an empty column
    * Cards may be removed from the Ace piles and placed back onto the playing field
    * Any number of cards can be moved in one move (as long as they are stacked as in Solitaire

    Features unique to this game:

    * The four individual cells start with cards in them
    * You may only go through the deck twice on draw one and three times on draw three
    * The obvious: there are only four columns, not 7 or 8 as in Solitaire and FreeCell, respectively
