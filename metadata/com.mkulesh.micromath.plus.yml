AutoName: microMathematics Plus
Description: |-
    With microMathematics Plus, not only can you perform mathematical calculations
    in naturally readable form but you can also create and manage your own
    collection of interactive formulas!

    microMathematics Plus is a revolutionary new kind of mobile calculator. It is a
    scientific graphing calculator and function plotter on Android oriented around a
    worksheet. It features live editing of mathematical identities combined with
    highly accurate computations.

    This app is not only for students. Anyone who enjoys mathematics or requires
    more than just a basic calculator will benefit from microMathematics' amazing
    calculations and plotting.

    * Verification, validation, documentation and re-use of mathematical calculations
    * Works on smartphone or tablet in portrait and landscape mode
    * Supports all commonly used mathematical operations
    * Mathematical expressions are written in an intuitive and naturally readable form
    * Supports SI and non-SI units (including units of information)
    * Powerful mathematical touch-screen editor with undo function which makes editing easier
    * You can perform multiple calculations and subsequently correct or change all used formulas
    * It is possible to store intermediate results into 1D, 2D, or 3D array that can improve calculation performance
    * Mathematical expressions are collected in a document, that includes not only formulas and plots, but also additional text and images (SVG format is also supported)
    * You can store your document on an SD card and export it into LaTeX format or an image (SD writing permission is needed)
    * SD card on Android 6+ is also supported
