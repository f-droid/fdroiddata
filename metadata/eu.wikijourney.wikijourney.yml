    Rediscover tourism with WikiJourney!

    [https://www.wikijourney.eu/ WikiJourney] is an app that allows tourists to
    visit a town with Wikipedia information. The app looks around the user for the
    points of interest, lists them, then creates a custom trail according to the
    user's likes and the time he has.

    Features:

    * Find POIs around me: the app locates you, and the automatically searches on English Wikipedia the available POIs.
    * Map display: once you have been located, the app displays your location with every POIs around you on a map. By tapping one of these points, a bubble displays more information, and links to the Wikipedia article.
    * List of POIs: a screen gathers every POIs found by the app, for a fast and easy interaction.
