'''Description'''

Mobile version of the Firefox web browser. Uses the Gecko layout engine to
render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
Features include: bookmark sync, custom search engines, support for addons and
the ability to enable or disable the search suggestions.

'''Anti-Features'''

* Non-free Addons: The license of the addons may be seen in the version notes, but often are non-free. The marketplace has no license information on most apps.
* Tracking: Stats are sent back regularly to the developers, but that can be disabled via settings. Also some versions contain "Adjust" tracking software.
* UpstreamNonFree: Contains proprietary software, e.g. play-services.
.

Maintainer Notes:
Binaries in repo for now, build process is large and complex. The binaries are
very well hidden - Mozilla appear very keen to force use of the proprietary market.
They come from here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/releases

The HTTP update check no longer works because they stopped putting any useful
info alongside the binaries.

Starting with 33.0 Firefox contains gms play-services due to chromecasting
capabilities.
