'''DEPRECATION NOTICE'''

Note that this package has been dropped from the F-Droid main repository and
only resides in the archive repository. Please consider using one of the
following options for updated builds:

* Manually download latest version from [https://download.mozilla.org/?product=fennec-latest&os=android&lang=multi Mozilla]
* [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/android/#nightly Firefox Nightly] - bleeding edge Firefox with automatic updates

We urged Mozilla to enable auto-updates for release builds in 2015 -- see
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1192279 bugzilla] -- but the issue
seems stalled. So even when you download Firefox manually, make sure you
revisited the download link from time to time.

'''Description'''

Mobile version of the Firefox web browser. Uses the Gecko layout engine to
render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
Features include: bookmark sync, custom search engines, support for addons and
the ability to enable or disable the search suggestions.

'''Anti-Features'''

* Non-free Addons: The license of the addons may be seen in the version notes, but often are non-free. The marketplace has no license information on most apps.
* Tracking: Stats are sent back regularly to the developers, but that can be disabled via settings. Also some versions contain "Adjust" tracking software.
* UpstreamNonFree: Contains proprietary software, e.g. play-services.
