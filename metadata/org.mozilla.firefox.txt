Changelog:https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases

Name:Firefox
Summary:Web browser
Description:
Mobile version of the Firefox web browser. Uses the Gecko layout engine to
render web pages, which
implements current and anticipated web standards. Features include: bookmark
sync, custom search engines,
support for addons and the ability to enable or disable the search suggestions.

Anti-features: Non-free Addons: The license of the addons/modules on
addons.mozilla.org may be seen in the version notes of the addon and often the
license is Custom or other non-free.
However there is no such license info for most apps from the marketplace.
Tracking: Stats are sent back regularly to the developers, but that can
be disabled via settings.

Note that this package is planned to be dropped from the F-Droid repo. Please
consider using [[org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid]] or other sources instead to be
sure of continued update support. You can always check
[https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/releases/latest/android-api-11/multi/ Mozilla's FTP server]
for the latest releases. There is also some work done on a standalone
update checker to atuomate that task, so you might want to checkout [[de.marmaro.krt.ffupdater]].

Maintainer Notes:
Binaries in repo for now, build process is large and complex. The binaries are
very well hidden - Mozilla appear very keen to force use of the proprietary market.
They come from here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/releases

The HTTP update check no longer works because they stopped putting any useful
info alongside the binaries.

Starting with 33.0 Firefox contains gms play-services due to chromecasting
capabilities.
