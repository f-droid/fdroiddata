Auto Name:My position
Summary:Share your location
Description:
A simple way of sharing your location via a widget. You can send a message
containing a link to a map of your current location via any standard
registered sharing application. For example, an SMS message.

The recipient is sent a link to a web page that displays the location
on a Google map, though the app itself uses OSM. (The source for the web
service is in the same repository as the client).

Anti-Feature:UpstreamNonFree - App now requires Google Play Services, and so
it can't be updated in our repos.
.

Repo Type:git-svn
#Note - deliberately pulling from trunk, not trunk/ShareMyPosition-android,
#even though that would be more efficient, in order to preserve the
#corresponding source for the web service in our source tarball.
