AutoName: BrightTime
Description: |-
    Adjusts your screen’s brightness based on the time of day. This improves your
    phone’s battery life. Other projects like Backlight! make it easier to manually
    adjust your brightness settings to save power, but BrightTime completely
    automates this process. Your phone will know the optimal brightness setting and
    adjust it for you. The default install is suitable for most users, but advanced
    users can thoroughly customize the schedule.
