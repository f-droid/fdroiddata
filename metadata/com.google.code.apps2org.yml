AutoName: Apps2Org
Description: |-
  Apps2Org is a fork of https://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.code.appsorganizer which fixes some
  usability issues. Apps2Org allows you to organize installed applications using
  labels/tags/categories. You can associate labels to applications, browse thru
  labeled categories and launch applications - either using the application or
  shortcut on your home screen.

  Comparing to original application, following changes were made:

  * "All labels" shortcut now includes "Other" (uncategorized) apps, so this shortcut completely replaces app launcher and gives access to all of your apps.
  * You can easily star/set label for an app directly from shortcut widget, so you can keep your app collection organized "right on the spot" with very little effort.
  * Other minor fixes and improvements.
