Description: |-
  Solar / calculated band conditions, Maidenhead Grid Locator & Callsign lookups
  via QRZ.com XML subscription. If you have a non-premium (free) account on
  QRZ.com, you will only get the name and country of callsigns. We are looking at
  offering more callsign databases. Many free sources only contain US hams, which
  is of limited use for many users.
