Auto Name:IMSDroid
Summary:High Quality Video SIP/IMS client
Description:
3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) is the next generation network for delivering IP multimedia
services. IMS is standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). IMS services could be
used over any type of network, such as 3GPP LTE, GPRS, Wireless LAN, CDMA2000 or fixed line.

IMSDroid is the first fully featured open source 3GPP IMS Client for Android
devices (1.5 and later). The main purpose of the project is to exhibit
doubango's features and to offer an IMS client to the open source community.
doubango is an experimental, open source, 3GPP IMS/LTE framework for both
embedded (Android, Windows Mobile, Symbian, iPhone, iPad, ...) and desktop
systems (Windows XP/Vista/7, MAC OS X, Linux, ...) and is written in ANSI-C to
ease portability. The framework has been carefully designed to efficiently
work on embedded systems with limited memory and low computing power. As the
SIP implementation follows RFC 3261 and 3GPP TS 24.229 Rel-9 specifications,
this will allow you to connect to any compliant SIP registrar.
