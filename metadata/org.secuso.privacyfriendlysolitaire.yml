AutoName: Solitaire
Description: |
    Privacy Friendly Solitiare is a Klondike Solitaire Game. Its goal is to move all cards to the foundations.
    A detailed description of the rules can be found in the app’s help site.

    The app provides different difficulty levels that draw either one or three cards from the deck. Additionally
    there are the following versions of counting points:

    * None: No points are counted.
    * Standard: The Player starts with zero points, moves give different points.
    * Vegas: The Player starts at -52 points and tries to get more than zero points, while the deck can only be passed through one time.

    The Player can generate an automatic move by clicking the Hint-Button or automatically move all possible cards
    to the foundation by shaking the device (if it is activated in the Settings). Addtionally he can undo and redo
    moves. Optionally he is shown the time of play. When the game is almost won (meaning that there are no more
    cards turned face-down), it will finish automatically.
    The app belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at the Karlsruhe
    Institute of Technology.
