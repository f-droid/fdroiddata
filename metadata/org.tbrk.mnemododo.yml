AutoName: Mnemododo
Description: |-
  Mnemododo allows cards from Mnemosyne (a spaced-repetition flash-card program)
  to be reviewed.

  Mnemododo does not replace Mnemosyne: cards are still added, edited, and deleted
  using a desktop or laptop computer.

  Rather, cards for several days are exported using the Mnemogogo plugin and then
  transferred to a mobile phone where they can be reviewed on the go. When those
  cards have been reviewed, they are imported back into Mnemosyne, and more cards
  may be exported.
