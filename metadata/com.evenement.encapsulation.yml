Description: |-
    Control tickets with an existing [http://www.e-venement.org/ e-venement]
    instance.

    When launched, the user is prompted to enter the host name as well as his login
    credentials wich will be stored for future authentifications.

    Once the form submitted, the app will connect to the instance’s server and
    display the access control page (tck.php/ticket/control), and tickets can be
    controlled directly from there.

    During use, the app will automatically re-authenticate the user on server
    periodically to keep the session alive as long as needed.
