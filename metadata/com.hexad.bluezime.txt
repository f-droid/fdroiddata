Summary:Play games with bluetooth controllers
Description:
This application installs a new IME (soft-keyboard) that can read data from a Bluetooth input device. Among
the supported devices are: Zeemote JS1, MSI Chainpus BGP100, Phonejoy and iControlPad (iCP). This is NOT a
bluetooth keyboard driver, it ONLY supports the devices listed above.Analog input is supported
but requires that the app you are using BluezIME with also supports it. Some of the
major emulators support BluezIME analog input, setup your controller inside the emulator app instead of
through the BluezIME interface if possible. If your favorite app does not support BluezIME analog input,
please write the publishers and ask for it!

Confirmed to work with almost all devices from HTC, Samsung and Motorola. Reported NOT working with any LG
device with stock ROM: http://code.google.com/p/android-bluez-ime/issues/detail?id=84
