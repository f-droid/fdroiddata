Description: |-
  The music app that comes bundled with CyanogenMod ROM v10. 1.0 is built at the
  latest commit from the original author's repo (because that still supports
  Android 2.3). Latest version is built from CM repos at cm-10.1.0-RC1 tag. It
  won't be possible to install this on CM10 because the apk is signed with a
  different key to that which is already installed.

  <i>N.B.</i> Version 1.1 is reported by upstream to work on 4.0 and later, but it
  really requires 4.1 or later. If your device runs 4.0.X, stick with 1.0.
