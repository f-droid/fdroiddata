AutoName: Headphone indicator
Description: |-
  Shows a notification icon in the status bar when headphones are plugged into the
  phone.

  After installation, you have to start the application at least once. Then it
  will be running as a background service that shows the headset status icon
  whenever the headphones are plugged in. You can close the app, and the status
  icon will still work - even after rebooting your phone.
