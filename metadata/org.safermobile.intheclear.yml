AutoName: InTheClear
Description: |-
  InTheClear is a suite of mobile applications designed to keep users safer in
  difficult situations by using their phone's built-in tools. At its core are two
  main features: Emergency SMS and Data Wipe. At installation, InTheClear walks a
  new user through the process of configuring each of these features. The user can
  then activate either Emergency SMS or Data Wipe individually, on an ad-hoc
  basis. In addition, they can simultaneously activate *both* Emergency SMS and
  Data Wipe via Panic!, a simple, one-touch feature of InTheClear.
