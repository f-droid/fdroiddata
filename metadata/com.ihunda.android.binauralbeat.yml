AutoName: Binaural Beats Therapy
Description: |-
  Binaural Beats stimulates your brain by sending special auditory artifacts
  directly into your headphones to produce subtle changes in behavior through
  entrainment of brainwaves frequency. Brain activity operates in waves whose
  frequency can be encouraged to change by the sound waves produced in the app.

  This app claims to help induce relaxation, creativity and many other desirable
  mental states.

  The app automatically pauses and resume if a phone call arrives. This is why
  PHONE_STATE permissions are required.
