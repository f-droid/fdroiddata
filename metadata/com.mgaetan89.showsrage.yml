AutoName: ShowsRage
Description: |-
  ShowsRage is an application that allows you to manage your
  <a href="https://www.sickrage.tv/">SickRage</a> installation.

  Support for <a href="http://www.sickbeard.com/">SickBeard</a> (or any other variant) is not
  guaranteed, but the main features should work properly.

  ShowsRage intend to provide the same features as on the web interface, packed
  inside a modern and easy-to-use Android application.

  The following features are currently available:

  * Support Android 4.0.3 and up
  * Based on <a href="https://www.google.com/design/">Material Design</a>
  * Shows information: list, get info, list seasons and episodes
  * Shows management: add, pause/resume, change quality, delete
  * Episode management: search, set status, stream, list coming
  * Logs
  * Shows statistics
  * Update SickRage (requires SickRage 4.0.30)

  The dependency on Google Play Services has been removed in this binary, but this
  prevents Casting from working.
