Summary:Car home-screen
Description:
PurpleDock is a simple replacement for the car dock app that ships with many
handsets.
PurpleDock works in both Portrait and Landscape orientation.
It works when connected to
power and disconnected.
GPS usage (used for speedometer) is throttled when not connected to
power in order to save battery life.

PurpleDock allows customization of three of the launch buttons.
The stickpin, headphones,
and microphone buttons are pre-assigned to Google Places, Google Music, and
Voice Search.
To override these buttons, tap and hold for 1 second to bring up an editor.
You will need to know
the full name of the application and the name of the Activity
to launch, which
can be got from [[com.ideasfrombrain.search_based_launcher_v2]] or
or the AndroidManifest.xml of the source code of the app.
