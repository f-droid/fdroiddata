Auto Name:Addi
Summary:Math calculation environment
Description:
Addi is a mathematical computing environment like Matlab and Octave, but made to
work on Android devices.

The goal is for 100% compliance with how Octave works including a compatibility
mode that makes the behavior more similar to Matlab (already very similar).
