Summary:GPS tracking
Description:
Record tracks, save waypoints, use compass, import/export data to many formats 
and much more! 

'''N.B.''' The track can't be viewed within the app because an API key for Google 
Maps is missing.
You can still use another app that supports OpenStreetMap and gpx files to view 
it though, such as
[[me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker]] or [[nl.sogeti.android.gpstracker]].

Anti-feature: Dependencies. It's necessary for Google Maps to be already 
installed either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be 
installable. We should be able to remove this dependency soon.
