Auto Name:Pocket Bandit
Summary:Slot-machine game
Description:
A comic style slot machine game. The game is
modelled after the classic, three reel, ten stops slot machines, made
popular by Mills Novelty. Unlike its mechanical cousins, Pocket Bandit is
not entirely luck based, but also offers elements of skill
and strategy game play.
Pull the lever to spin the reels and push it up to stop them spinning.
