AutoName: Web Media Share
Summary: Browser for viewing, sharing, or casting media from websites
Description: |
    WebMediaShare is an app to browse your favourite media websites (e.g. online
    streaming sites, online radio stations, etc.) so that you can:

    * view the content without ads/popups/redirects/etc.
    * share music from a streaming site to a media player app like VLC, so that it continues playing even if the screen is off
    * send the media to your TV or Hifi (e.g. via the Kore app for Kodi, [[org.xbmc.kore]]). This works like Chromecast, but without the need for the Chromecast device, a Google account, Google Play Services, or special support for the site.
    * share the media URL to friends on chats or email
    * share the media to an app for downloading
