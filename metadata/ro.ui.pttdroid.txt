Summary:Walkie Talkie/Push to Talk
Description:
Talk with other people on the same WiFi network. The app uses broadcast and multicast for
communication over the same local network (WiFi) and unicast for point-to-point communication, which also
works on GSM. Uses Speex (http://www.speex.org/) for voice encoding which can be adapted to the bandwidth.
