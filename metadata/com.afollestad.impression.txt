Description:
Image gallery based on material design. This build removes non-free crashlytics
sofware and will most likely not see any updates, since upstream now uses
Google's play-services, a non-free dependecy, e.g. for media casting.

This build might be unstable and crash when not used in "explorer mode". Please
don't report issues to upstream that are not present in
[https://github.com/afollestad/impression/releases official builds].

Maintainer Notes:
This app has been moved to the archive because people did complain to upstream -- just what I told them NOT to do. People don't read... sad, but true.

* Strip crashlytics from newer versions
* Strip play-services from newer versions
* UCM:Tags after next release
* Add -fdroid suffix?
* AutoName is a variable, so dont use it
* Maybe find someone to maintain a floss fork?
