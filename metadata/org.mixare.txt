Summary:Augmented reality browser
Description:
Point the camera and see what's around. Uses a variety of sources, including
Wikipedia , Twitter,
OpenStreetMap and mixare.org. Versions after 0.9.2 are built from a
different repository
which avoids the Google Maps
requirement and uses OSM instead. (This is not fully implemented yet).

Google Maps don't function in the f-droid.org build, because API keys
aren't in the source code.

Anti-feature: Dependencies. It's necessary for Google Maps to be already
installed either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be
installable. We should be able to remove this dependency soon.
