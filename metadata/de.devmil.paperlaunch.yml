AutoName: PaperLaunch
Summary: Side launcher in material design that launches apps with one gesture
Description: |-
    PaperLaunch is a side launcher. Tired of hopping back to your home screen to
    launch that one app while you are inside another one? Have you used a side
    launcher and

    * are frustrated because you have to do multiple gestures to launch the app?
    * activate it accidentally by touching the activation zone and immediately launch the app that happens to be on that spot?
    * do you miss the ability to define a folder structure in that launcher?

    Then PaperLaunch is the perfect side launcher for you. Try it!

    PaperLaunch is open source! You can find it on GitHub.
