AutoName: Migraine Tracker
Description: |-
  Migraine Tracker is a simple event tracking app. Originally designed as a
  personal application to track migraines, it can be used to track any recurring
  event's time and duration for later analysis.

  The UI is designed to be as simple as possible, allowing ease of use during
  severe headaches or other events where a complex or feature-heavy UI is
  unwelcome.

  Migraine Tracker does not, and is not intended to, diagnose or treat any
  condition. It merely collects data for later analysis by a qualified
  professional instead of using paper forms or notebooks. All data is stored
  locally on your Android device, and only event duration and score is stored.
