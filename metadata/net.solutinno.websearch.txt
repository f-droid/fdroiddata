Auto Name:WebSearch
Summary:Search the web from within apps
Description:
If an app allows you to select plain text then the selected text is shared to this app,
which in turn, opens it in your search engine of choice, provided it obeys 
the OpenSearch format.

You manage your search engines on the admin UI. 
You can import engines from an url, or you can add new engines by hand: for 
examples, see OpenSearch engines from [http://mycroftproject.com Mycroft project] 
and http://www.searchplugins.net. 
If you tap the import icon on the action bar, a dialog will appear. 
You have to fill the url edit box, then tap the import button. 
You have to fill in at least the name and the url fields. 
There is a paste icon on the right side of the url field; if you tap this icon, 
it will paste a "{searchTerms}" string into the url field. 
This is necessary because this string will be replaced by your search string in the url.

For example, Wikipedia English is:
[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&search={searchTerms}&button=1 https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&search={searchTerms}&button=1]
