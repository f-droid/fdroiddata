Summary:Record video secretly
Description:
This app records audio or video secretly and sends the results to OpenWatch: a
participatory citizen media project to enable public monitoring of authority
figures. See the tutorial section in the app for details on how to work it as it
is deliberately made unobvious. All uploads are released under CC-BY (Creative
