Summary:Record video secretly
Description:
This app records audio or video secretly and sends the results to OpenWatch: a participatory citizen media
project to enable public monitoring of authority figures. See the tutorial
section in the app for details on how to work it as it is deliberately made unobvious. All uploads are
released under CC-BY (Creative Commons Attribution License) but personally identifiable information can
be suppressed if stated in the accompanying upload note.
