AutoName: Daily Dozen
Description: |-
    In the years of research required to create the more than a thousand
    evidence-based videos on NutritionFacts.org, Michael Greger, MD, FACLM, has
    arrived at a list of what he considers the most important foods to include in a
    healthy daily diet.

    Yes, greens are good for you, but how much should we try to eat each day? Dr.
    Greger’s Daily Dozen details the healthiest foods and how many servings of each
    we should try to check off every day. He explains his rationale in his book
    <a href="https://NutritionFacts.org/book">How Not to Die</a>. All his proceeds from his
    books, DVDs, and speaking engagements is all donated to charity.

    NutritionFacts.org is a non-commercial, nonprofit, science-based public service
    provided by Dr. Greger, providing free daily updates on the latest in nutrition
    research via bite-sized videos. He has nearly a thousand videos on every aspect
    of healthy eating, with new videos and articles uploaded every day. Like this
    app, everything on the website is both free of ads and free of charge.

    This app was developed thanks to the volunteer efforts of John Slavick.
