Description: |-
    * Record your daily expense, income, asset and liability
    * Show and count the details
    * Export/Import to CSV
    * Pie and time chart of balance

    The app has been built without the non-FOSS Google Analytics, so no usage
    statistics will be sent. Also the INTERNET permission has been removed as it
    didn’t seem to be needed for anything else.
