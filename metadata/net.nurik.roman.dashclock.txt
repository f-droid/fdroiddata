Auto Name:DashClock Widget
Summary:Extensible lock screen widget
Description:
'''For versions 1.4.3 and below''', the Weather extension requires Network 
Location, the non-free system app that's found on devices that have the other 
proprietary Google services. 
Later versions allow for the location to be set manually

DashClock is a replacement lock screen clock widget for Android 4.2+. It also
exposes additional status items called extensions. The widget comes bundled
with extensions that give you instant access to:
* Missed calls and unread text messages
* Your next calendar appointment
* Your next scheduled alarm

To add the widget to your Android 4.2 device's lock screen, simply swipe to the
left-most page of your lock screen and touch the "+" icon. Then, select
"DashClock" to customize and add the widget. You can make this the primary lock
screen widget, replacing the default clock, by first touching-and-holding it
and then dragging it horizontally to the very rightmost position.
