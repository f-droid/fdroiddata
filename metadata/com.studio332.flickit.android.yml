AutoName: flickit
Description: |-
  It combines aspects of shuffleboard, 9-ball and bumper pool into a unique new
  gameplay experience. Use your shooter puck to knock white targets into the holes
  for points. In 9-ball, the lowest numbered target must be hit first, but it
  doesn't matter which target is holed.

  FlickIt! is easy to learn, yet difficult to master. Just drag your finger to
  aim, tap and hold to increase power, and release to shoot. Be careful you don't
  overpower and miss the shot! Challenge your friends to see who is the true
  FlickIt! master.
