AutoName: Comfort Reader
Description: |-
    Comfort Reader makes reading easier for you. It streams any text directly to
    your eyes. Smart text processing and colored letter animation help you to
    recognize and understand text faster and better. Reading a book will seem just
    like watching a film, at the speed that works best for you.   Main features
    include:   supported file formats: txt and pdf displays; just the current phrase
    you are about to read; makes sure that associated words won't get chopped
    randomly (as in conventional Speed Reading Apps with Rapid Serial Visual
    Presentation); creates a fluent stream of text at your desired speed; colored
    letter animation stimulates better concentration and comprehension; trains your
    reading, reduces regression and expands your vision span; fully costumizable
    text appearance and reading configuration
