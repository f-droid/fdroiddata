AutoName: Just Search
Description: |-
  <b>Note:</b> this app is discontinued.

  Just Search is an Assist replacement (the app that launches after long pressing
  home) and cannot be launched via the launcher. To use it, navigate to the device
  settings and change the default Assist app.

  Just Search provides a simple way to search from everywhere without needing to
  launch the heavy (in terms of data and resources' needs) Google search app. Just
  Search uses DuckDuckGo by default, but allows opting for a multitude of
  predefined search providers instead. It also allows setting a custom search URL
  so that any search engine is supported.
