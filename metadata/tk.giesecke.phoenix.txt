Auto Name:Phoenix
Summary:Set time for autoreboot and startup apps
Description:
Reboot your phone in a given interval on a specific time and start a
specific application after reboot. The idea is to restart Android and
an application periodically to clean up cache and memory leaks if the
application has to run over a long time.

And if you don't need to restart an application, still this can help
to close memory leaks. No background services - reboot is scheduled by
system AlarmManager. Before reboot is applied, all apps get a shutdown
call to save there data. This helps to prevent data loss!

Configuration allows

* selection of reboot interval from every day to every 30 days
* selection of reboot time from midnight to 11pm
* selection between hard reboot (complete restart) or soft/hot reboot (only restart apps)
* selection if you want to start an app automatically after reboot
* selection of any app to be started automatically after reboot
.
