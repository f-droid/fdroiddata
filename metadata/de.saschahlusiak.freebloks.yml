Description: |-
    Strategy board game similar to the famous board game Blokus.

    Try to place as many tiles on the board as possible, keeping in mind only two
    simple rules: your tiles must touch a corner of one of your previously placed
    tiles, but they must not share an edge. Can you play more tiles than your
    opponents?
