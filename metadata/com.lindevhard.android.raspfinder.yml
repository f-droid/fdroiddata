AutoName: RaspFinder
Description: |-
  RaspFinder will tell you the IP address of your RaspberryPi on your Wi-Fi network.
  RaspFinder helps you to find your device in case, when

  * you are not able to access your Raspberry directly
  * you can't browse your router for a connected devices list
  * you have your Raspberry at hand, but too lazy to connect it via HDMI or Ethernet

  All you need to care about - that the Raspberry and your smartphone are on the same network.

  <b>Features:</b>

  * quick search: within 2-3 secs
  * simple and intuitive interface
  * does not include advertising
  * low application weight
  * decent and modern design

  <b>Attention:</b> does NOT work if you are using MAC address spoofing!
