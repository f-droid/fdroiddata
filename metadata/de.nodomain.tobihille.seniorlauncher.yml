AutoName: Senior Launcher
Description: |-
  What does this app do?
  * It registers as app launcher (that means it is called when the phone boots and the home button is pressed).
  * It lets the user decide if they want to call someone or want to watch images.
  * It reads the contact list and displays all contacts that have an image and a phone number (only the first number is used!).
  * Every contact is displayed as a large button with the contact's image on it.
  * On click either a call to the contact is initialized or the SMS app is opened to show images sent via MMS
  * In image-mode the gallery can be opened
  * Calling the ambulance is added on top of the list in the call-screen.
  * Language: English and German. (911 and 112 for calling the ambulance is translated of course)

  Why is MMS used for images?
  * Because it is available everywhere and every phone has an app installed that can use it
  * Because it is the only way (that I found out) to direct the user right to the newest images

  I recommend the use of https://f-droid.org/packages/com.moez.QKSMS as a SMS/MMS app because it
  copies all images automatically to the gallery and because it's free.
