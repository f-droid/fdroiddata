Name:Androidomatic Keyer
Auto Name:AKA
Summary:Morse code keyer
Description:
This project enables ham radio operators to use their android phones as memory keyers to send CW or Hellschreiber signals using any radio transmitter capable of putting out a carrier wave. The application presents a list of editable phrases, then plays the selected phrase as morse code (or Hellschriber) through the sound output. The audible tones produced may be used directly if a modulated signal is desired, but the sound can also be routed through an easy-to-build interface which converts this sound into on/off keying for the transmitter.
