AutoName: K-9 Mail DashClock Extension
Summary: Email info on the lockscreen
Description: |-
    '''NOTE:''' This app is no longer maintained (its repo was archived).

    [[net.nurik.roman.dashclock]] extension that displays the number of unread
    emails from [[com.fsck.k9]], from your choice of accounts.

    Marking messages as read in K-9 won’t reliably update the unread count if you
    are using v4.201 of K-9 — current versions of K-9 should work fine.
