Auto Name:Tinfoil for Facebook
Summary:Facebook mobile browser with privacy
Description:
Browse Facebook's mobile site with a simple web browser, which protects your
privacy by avoiding the ability of the page and others to track your browsing
history. It also includes other functionalities, like shortcuts to the
notifications page or app settings to control whether your current location is
to be provided to Facebook's website.

The COARSE_LOCATION permission is only used if you enable "Allow Check-ins" on
the preferences section, which is disabled by default.

AntiFeatures:
* Nonfreenet. The app uses Facebook.
* NonFreeAd. In the near future, a non-free add-on will add features to this app.
