AutoName: Repay
Description: |-
  Lending money to your friends can get messy. You can lose track and have
  disputes over it, or forget altogether. With Repay you can keep track of
  everything you've lent them, and what they've lent you too using a simple, fast
  system to store an IOU in your device so you never forget. There's no need to
  make any accounts or give any bank account information, it's just a simple
  record you keep to make sure you're never out of pocket.
