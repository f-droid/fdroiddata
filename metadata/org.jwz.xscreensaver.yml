Description: |
    XScreenSaver has about 150 different live wallpapers (and now daydreams as well) to use on your screen - with more coming in future editions!  This is one of the best and most robust live wallpaper apps out there.

    The Android port is fairly recent, some of the demos don't work yet.

    If you are an Android developer and you'd like to help us finish it, source code is available at [https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/].

MaintainerNotes: |
    `make all` already does the gradle build. Running gradle standalone doesn't work as is afterwards beause of undefined env variables.
    Disabling the preBuild tasks in the gradle file works around this issue.
