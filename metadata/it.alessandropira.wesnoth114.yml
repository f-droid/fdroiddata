MaintainerNotes: Source code is located in the "files" section of SF in the form of
    tarballs. No VCS is used. The actual repo is a placeholder and not required at
    all (F-Droid buildserver still requires some repo, though). The source code is
    split into two parts, the library tarball and the game tarball. Each one is downloaded
    and their checksums are checked. The build process should not change across new
    versions and the build and init sections can be copied over, with updated links
    to the library and wesnoth tarballs as well as their checksums (first four lines
    in init section). The wesnoth tarball contains prebuilt libs, but we're removing
    them with scandelete and building again from source. The library tarball also
    contains various binaries, but they are not used in build and can be safely removed.
    The only prebuilt component in libraries tarball (that's used in building wesnoth)
    is openssl library, which we're building again.
