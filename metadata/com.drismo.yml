Summary: Driving feedback
Description: |-
    Today’s technology already allow drivers to be guided by a GPS. To take this a
    step further, this app provides a system to monitor and analyze the driving
    quality by using the accelerometer (G-sensor) of your smartphone. This will help
    you determine if the driving is good or bad, helping you improving your own
    driving skills. Hence the name “Driving Skill Monitor” (DriSMo).

    The goal of this application is to emphasize the attention towards good driving
    quality and make the drivers aware of their own driving quality. By raising the
    awareness of driving quality, you can increase the quality of driving. Fuel
    efficiency will also be improved, as a result.
