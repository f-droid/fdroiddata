Auto Name:Kakugo
Summary:Learn Japanese with Kakugo
Description:
Kakugo is an application that helps learning Japanese. It includes multiple
tests to memorize hiragana, katakana, and kanji and adapts to the user's
learning pace.

One of the biggest difficulty with learning Japanese is memorizing kanji and
vocabulary. While learning them by just reading and writing them everyday may
work, the more kanji you know, the harder it gets and the more time it takes to
revise them all. Proper tools can help you memorize these huge amounts of
knowledge to more quickly become a fluent Japanese speaker.

Kakugo is one of these tools. It helps learning and revising kanji and
vocabulary in an efficient manner. It uses Spaced Repetition in a unique way
that adapts to the user's pace. If you only have time to revise 30 kanji every
day, or if you can revise as much as 100 kanji every day, Kakugo will adapt and
test you on the right kanji at the right time for you to memorize them. There is
no "kanji of the day" list to revise, you can start and finish a session
whenever you feel like it.

Kakugo also features a wide variety of tests to help you find the best ways that
will help you learn Japanese.
