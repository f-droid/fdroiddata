AutoName: SD Scanner
Description: |-
    Rescan storage media like SD cards for changes. ''SD Scanner'' uses a method
    compatible with 4.4 KitKat and 5.0 Lollipop.

    In Android 4.4 KitKat, the method used by most older programs to rescan a
    storage medium no longer works. Instead, an interface must be used that only
    allows one file to be specified at a time. This app works by determining what
    files/folders might need to be scanned again, and then by calling the correct
    API on each file/folder.

    SD Scanner can be used with Tasker by using the "Send Intent" action listed
    under "System." Use the following settings, leaving the ones I don't list at the
    default:

    * Action: android.intent.action.RUN
    * Package: com.gmail.jerickson314.sdscanner
    * Class: com.gmail.jerickson314.sdscanner.MainActivity
    * Target: Activity
