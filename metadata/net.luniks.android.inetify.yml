AutoName: Inetify
Description: |-
    Inetify is an Android tool providing two features related to Wifi networks:
    1.Give a notification if a Wifi network does not provide internet access.
    2.Automatically activate Wifi when near a Wifi network and deactivate it
    otherwise: this is experimental and will use GPS when necessary, thus draining
    the battery

    '''N.B''' It isn't possible to view your position on a map because Google Maps
    is the only map source and f-droid can't supply an API key to use it. If you
    need to use Google Maps install the developer's build from the website.
