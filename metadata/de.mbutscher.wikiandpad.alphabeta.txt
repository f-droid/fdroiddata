Name:WikiAndPad
Auto Name:WikiAndPad alpha/beta
Summary:WikidPad for Android
Description:
WikidPad is a Wiki-like notebook for storing your thoughts, ideas, todo lists,
contacts, or anything else you can think of to write down. It is Open Source
and available for Windows (binary installer) and Linux and Mac OS (as Python
source). You can clip snippets from a browser, syntax-highlight wiki words and
search notes. This app is in the early stages of development so is considered
alpha. WikidAndPad uses text files indexed by a
database stored on your sdcard, but it is currently not possible to create the
database from within the app. First, you must create the database of the type
Original Sqlite within WikidPad on the desktop and copy it to your sdcard.
