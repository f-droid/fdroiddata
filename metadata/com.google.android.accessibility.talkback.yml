AutoName: TalkBack
Description: |-
    TalkBack is an Accessibility Service that helps blind and vision-impaired users
    interact with their devices more easily.

    This application adds spoken, audible, and vibration feedback to your device.

    It comes pre-installed on many devices so you won't be able to install this if
    that is the case.

    It's only activated if you explicitly turn on Accessibility:

    # Go to Settings
    # Select Accessibility
    # Enable TalkBack checkboxes

    This app is for Android 8.0 or later. If your device runs an older version of Android, you should use [[com.android.talkback]] instead.
