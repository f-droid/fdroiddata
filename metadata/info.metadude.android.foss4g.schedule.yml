  <b>About FOSS4G</b>
  The Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial Europe (FOSS4GE)
  conference is the European branch event of the Open Source Geospatial
  Foundation (OSGeo) annual conference.

  OSGeo is the largest and most important international organization
  that unites the community of developers, users, and advocates of
  free and open source in geospatial.

  The main focus of the organization is fostering the development,
  maintenance, and use of free and open source software for geospatial,
  open standards, and open data. The democratizing nature of the field
  creates a basis for sharing geographic data, promotes cooperation
  between organizations and individuals, and enables the application of
  data in solving the most diverse everyday problems, being the basis
  for such fields as map applications, logistics, transport, infrastructure
  planning, organizing rescue work in disaster areas, etc.

  FOSS4G is a community event organized by volunteers, with a focus on
  building a diverse and sustainable open community, sharing our own
  experiences, and learning from others. Although it is software that
  brings us together, it’s the deep care for the society and the
  environment that surrounds us, helping solve the World’s problems
  one bit at a time, that connects us.
