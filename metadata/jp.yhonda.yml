AutoName: MaximaOnAndroid
Description: |-
  Maxima, a full featured computer algebra system, now runs on your Android mobile
  devices. Maxima, and its predecessor Macsyma is one of the most long-established
  software in the world, back in 1960s at MIT LCS and Project Mac. You can perform
  many many math operations such as integration, differentiation, matrix
  operations, rational numbers, symbolic treatment of constants such as pi, e,
  euler's gamma, symbolic and numerical treatment of special functions such as
  sin(x), cos(x), log(x), exp(x), zeta(s), and many more.

  Maxima on Android is a port of Maxima on the Android operating system. Thanks to
  Sylvain Ageneau' effort on porting Embeddable Common Lisp to the Android OS, the
  latest Maxima code runs nicely on ECL on Android with very small changes to the
  source code.

  The installation of the software requires total of 90MB on the storage. 30MB
  needs to be installed on the internal storage. The rest of 60MB can be installed
  either on the external or the internal storage. The first run of the apk will
  ask you where you want the 60MB to be installed.
