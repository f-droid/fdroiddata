AutoName: FastHub
Summary: A GitHub client app built from ground up
Description: |-
  <b>Warning:</b> Upstream deleted fdroid flavor with some strange reasoning.
  Locked/deleted comments, general attitude suggest FastHub is gone forever.
  You could try its fork https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fastaccess.github.libre instead.

  Yet another open-source GitHub client app but unlike any other app, FastHub was
  built from scratch.
