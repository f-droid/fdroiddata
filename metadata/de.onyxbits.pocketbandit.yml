AutoName: Pocket Bandit
Description: |-
  A comic style slot machine game. The game is modelled after the classic, three
  reel, ten stops slot machines, made popular by Mills Novelty. Unlike its
  mechanical cousins, Pocket Bandit is not entirely luck based, but also offers
  elements of skill and strategy game play. Pull the lever to spin the reels and
  push it up to stop them spinning.
