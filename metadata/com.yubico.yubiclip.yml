AutoName: YubiClip
Description: |-
  Read a One-Time Password (OTP) from a YubiKey NEO over NFC, and copy it to the
  system clipboard.

  Once installed the app does not need to be started. Just swiping the YubiKey NEO
  against the phones NFC reader will cause it to run, displaying a message to
  indicate that the OTP has been copied, all without leaving the currently running
  app.

  Note that the default NDEF programming needs to be used. If you've reprogrammed
  the NDEF tag of your YubiKey NEO, you will need to change it back to the URL:
  https://my.yubico.com/neo/

  This can be done using the
  <a href="http://opensource.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization-gui/">personalization
  tool</a>.

  When using a YubiKey NEO with a static password in scan code mode you will need
  to configure which keyboard layout to use in the YubiClip Settings. Currently
  only the US layout is supported. If you would like to see additional layout
  support, please consider contributing code via a pull request to
  <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/yubiclip-android/">our source code repositiory</a>.
