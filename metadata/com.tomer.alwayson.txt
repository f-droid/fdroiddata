Auto Name:Always On AMOLED
Summary:Display some information at all times
Description:
The idea is to provide users with information about, time, date, notifications

This is made possible thanks to AMOLED displays. Most of the screen stays black
except for a few pixels.

* Auto movement: avoid AMOLED burn-in
* Auto night mode: dim the screen automatically in dark environment
* Pocket mode: lock the device when you leave it in your pocket to save battery
* Custom watch faces: Digital S7 style, Classic 24H, Analog S7 style, Analog Pebble style and more!
* Always On Memo: write a reminder and make it show up on your screen all the time!
* Double tap to wake + Swipe up to wake + Volume keys to wake + Back button to wake
* Force orientation: set your preferred screen orientation
* Customization: change the text color, text size, font, brightness and more
* Greenify integration: start Greenify automatically when locking the screen to save battery
* Force doze: activate doze when the screen is in the always on state
