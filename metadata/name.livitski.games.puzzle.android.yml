Description: |-
  n-Puzzle app is a classic sliding puzzle game based on the Fifteen Puzzle. It
  allows you to choose among three levels of complexity: 3×3 (8-puzzle), 4×4
  (15-puzzle), and 5×5 (24-puzzle), hence the name.

  In addition to standard square boards with numbers, you can choose a board with
  a picture painted on it. There are three stock pictures installed with the
  puzzle, and you can add your own pictures by pressing Menu button when the
  picture selection page is displayed. The picture you select will be split into
  equal tiles.
