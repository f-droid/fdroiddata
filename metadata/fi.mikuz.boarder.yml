AutoName: Boarder
Summary: Create and share soundboards
Description: |-
    Boarder is an app for creating and managing soundboards - the aural equivalent
    of a painter’s palette.

    Dropbox support will not work, due to the fact that api keys are not in the
    source. The app is still in beta: internet features are not fully tested and
    documentation is not good. Minor known bugs included.
