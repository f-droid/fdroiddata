Description: |-
    N.B. This probably won't work on Android 4.1+.

    Simple tool for android development that sends a log to UDP port or share it via
    email, bluetooth, etc. Background service is collecting logs and sending them to
    destination IP and UDP port. You can send logs to desktop computer through home
    wifi network, or to server with public IP or cname.

    To listen logs use this python script:
    [https://github.com/Chemik/logcatudp/blob/master/test/listener.py]
