Auto Name:Toggle Headset 2
Summary:Widget for re-routing audio
Description:
This was originally designed to fix software problems in Android 1.5 that
wouldn't properly route audio
when the headset was plugged in and out.
However many people have found it to be able to fix hardware
problems too and it can be used to manually route audio to the speakers for
no special reason.
