Description: |-
  The Warm Showers Community is a free worldwide hospitality exchange for
  touring cyclists. People who are willing to host touring cyclists sign up
  and provide their contact information, and may occasionally have someone
  stay with them and share great stories and a drink. All members agree to
  host others either now or in the future, but for some members hosting may
  be in years or even decades in their future.

  Members of Warmshowers.org can use this app to find hosts using both map and
  textual search interfaces. Hosts can be contacted directly through the app.
  Host information can also be downloaded and stored for offline usage.
