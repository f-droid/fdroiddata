AutoName: ${appName}
Summary: View images
Description: |-
    Image gallery based on material design. This build removes non-free crashlytics
    sofware and will most likely not see any updates, since upstream now uses
    Google's play-services, a non-free dependecy, e.g. for media casting.

    This build might be unstable and crash when not used in "explorer mode". Please
    don't report issues to upstream that are not present in
    [https://github.com/afollestad/impression/releases official builds].

MaintainerNotes: |-
    This app has been moved to the archive because people did complain to upstream -- just what I told them NOT to do. People don't read... sad, but true.

    * Strip crashlytics from newer versions
    * Strip play-services from newer versions
    * UCM:Tags after next release
    * Add -fdroid suffix?
    * AutoName is a variable, so dont use it
    * Maybe find someone to maintain a floss fork?
