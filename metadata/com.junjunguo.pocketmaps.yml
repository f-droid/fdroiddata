AutoName: PocketMaps
Summary: View maps and use offline routing and navigation system
Description: |-
    PocketMaps is a map viewer with navigation system.

    Maps can be easily downloaded with this app. Thus, a complete offline navigation
    is possible. Through the so-called geocoding places can be searched.

    * The search requires an internet connection.
    * A very limited offline search is also available.

    With the sport tracking feature, routes can be recorded to graph data such as
    speeds.
