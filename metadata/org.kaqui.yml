Summary: Learn Japanese with Kakugo
Description: |-
    Kakugo is an application that helps learning Japanese. It includes multiple
    tests to memorize hiragana, katakana, and kanji and adapts to the user's
    learning pace.

    One of the biggest difficulty with learning Japanese is memorizing kanji
    and vocabulary. While learning them by just reading and writing them
    everyday may work, the more kanji you know, the harder it gets and the more
    time it takes to revise them all. Proper tools can help you memorize these
    huge amounts of knowledge to more quickly become a fluent Japanese speaker.

    Kakugo is one of these tools. It helps learning and revising kanji and
    vocabulary in an efficient manner. It uses Spaced Repetition in a unique
    way that adapts to the user's pace. If you only have time to revise 30
    kanji every day, or if you can revise as much as 100 kanji every day,
    Kakugo will adapt and test you on the right kanji at the right time for you
    to memorize them. There is no "kanji of the day" list to revise, you can
    start and finish a session whenever you feel like it.

    Kakugo also features a wide variety of tests to help you find the best ways
    that will help you learn Japanese.
