Description: |-
  GZDoom is a feature centric port for all Doom
  engine games, based on ZDoom, adding an OpenGL
  renderer and powerful scripting capabilities.

  In addition to Doom, GZDoom supports Heretic,
  Hexen, Strife, Chex Quest, and other games
  based on the Doom engine.

  The Freedoom project aims to create a complete
  free content game based on the Doom engine.

  Combined with the engine, Freedoom is also
  compatible with game modifications (“mods”) made
  for the original Doom games, made by Doom fans
  and artists over the decades.

  In addition to Freedoom 1 & 2 WADs, this app
  comes with more level packs: Sigil, 10 sectors
  and 10 sectors part 2.

  Note: this is an unofficial port of GZDoom and
  FreeDoom to android and it's not affiliated with
  these projects.
