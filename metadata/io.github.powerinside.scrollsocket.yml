AutoName: ScrollSocket
Description: |-
  ScrollSocket sends mouse wheel events to the computer as you move your finger
  over the android touchscreen. Requires a small driver to be running on the
  computer.  See <a href="http://powerinside.github.io/ScrollSocket/">website</a> for more
  details on building the driver from source.

  * Currently supports only linux with uinput kernel module.
  * Horizontal scrolling not yet added.

  This is a fork of the much awesome https://f-droid.org/packages/at.bitfire.gfxtablet app.
