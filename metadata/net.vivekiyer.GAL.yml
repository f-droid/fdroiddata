AutoName: Corporate Addressbook
Description: |-
  The Global Address List (GAL) lookup available in Android is limited in
  functionality. It only looks up the email address and does not provide other
  information that is available in the GAL. This application looks up the GAL and
  returns ALL data that is available on the Exchange server for the query.
