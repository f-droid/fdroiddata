Summary:Guided at-home exercises
Description:
Feeel is an open-source Android app for doing simple at-home exercises. While it
currently only holds the scientific 7-minute workout regime, the hope is to
expand the amount of available exercises with the help of the community and to
allow creating custom regimes, with an assortment of handful time-proven regimes
built-in to start with.
