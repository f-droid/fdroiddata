Description: |-
    Keypad-Mapper 3 makes it easy for you to record the GPS coordinates of house
    numbers for adding them later to OpenStreetMap.

    Features:

    * records house numbers
    * saves address data
    * takes GPS photos for entering in JOSM
    * indicates the GPS reception strength of GPS and GLONASS
    * exports the recorded information

    Note that although it's not mentioned anywhere except very deep in the help
    page, this application collects and uploads GSM cell data. See
    [https://f-droid.org/repository/issues/?do=view_issue&issue=421 here] for more
    information.
