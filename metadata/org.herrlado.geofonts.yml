AutoName: Georgian Fonts Installer
Description: |-
  Install Georgian fonts if you don't have them already.

  Fonts have an AOSP base with added glyphs from
  <a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/index.php?title=Besarion_Gugushvili">DejaVu</a>.
  Installation will overwrite the default fonts that you already have and make a
  backup of them.

  If it doesn't work maybe you don't have S-OFF or are currently using a
  non-default font. Reboot after installation. The suggested log application isn't
  free so use https://f-droid.org/packages/org.jtb.alogcat instead.

  Requires root: Yes. Android fonts are always located in /system

RequiresRoot: true
