AutoName: Seafile
Summary: File synchronization
Description: |-
    Client for the Seafile cloud file server and project management software. If you
    are in a small team with a few people, you can create a group in Seafile and
    invite other team members. Team members can then maintain file libraries
    together and collaborate around them.

    You can try the [https://seacloud.cc/demo demo], sign up for an account at the
    website, or since the server-side is also free-as-in-freedom, it can be
    installed on any server and configured to work with the app.
