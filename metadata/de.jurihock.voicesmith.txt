Summary:Real-time voice changer
Description:
Voicesmith records an audio signal from the built-in microphone, processes it in some
 way and plays it back through the earphones. There are some of the classical Phase
Vocoder effects available. Voicesmith can also be used to perform the Delayed Auditory
Feedback (DAF) and Frequency-Shifted Auditory Feedback (FAF).
