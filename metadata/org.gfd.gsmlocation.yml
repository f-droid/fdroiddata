Name: GSMLocationNlpBackend
AutoName: GSMLocationBackend
Description: |-
  https://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.android.gms backend that uses <a href="http://opencellid.org">OpenCellID</a>.

  Location calculation is done onboard and works without network connectivity. The
  cell-tower based lookup for your current location is implemented via a included
  binary cell database extracted from <a href="http://opencellid.org">OpenCellID</a>.

  This "NetworkLocationProvider" works without network connectivity and will never
  post your data anywhere. You are thus encouraged to help OpenCellID to gather
  more cells in order to improve this project.

  https://f-droid.org/packages/de.enaikoon.android.keypadmapper3 can be used to gather cell information for
  OpenCellID.

  <b>Warning:</b> This app drains battery and seems no longer maintained.
