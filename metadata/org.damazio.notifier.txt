Maintainer Notes:
The build is disabled because it was never published by upstream, and judging
by the content of the issue tracker and short history, it's possibly unfinished
and/or broken. That said, it appears to be long since abandonded, so if someone
can confirm that what exists is actually working and useful, we could probably
publish this version anyway.
