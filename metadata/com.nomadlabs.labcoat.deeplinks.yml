AutoName: Deep Links for LabCoat
Description: |-
  Deep Links for LabCoat is a utility app that does one thing and only one
  thing: it allows you to open links to non-gitlab.com GitLab instances -
  for example, gitlab.gnome.org - in the <i>LabCoat for GitLab</i> app.

  <b>Known issues:</b>

  LabCoat opens but link does not load - Make sure you are signed in to an
  account on the Gitlab instance you are trying to access. LabCoat is
  unable to display anything from a Gitlab instance without a valid
  personal access token - even if the url you are trying to access is public
  on the web.
