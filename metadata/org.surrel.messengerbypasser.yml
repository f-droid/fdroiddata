AutoName: Messenger bypasser
Description: |-
  <b>Note:</b> This app is discontinued and has been replaced by
  https://f-droid.org/packages/it.rignanese.leo.slimfacebook.

  Bypasses the requirement for Messenger. In certain conditions, Facebook forces
  the start of Messenger, which crashes the browser (i.e. Tinfoil for Facebook).
  This app intercepts this start to prevent the crash and sends back the user to
  the webapp.
