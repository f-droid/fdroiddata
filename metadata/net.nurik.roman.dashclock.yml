AutoName: DashClock Widget
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> this app was deprecated by its author.

  DashClock is a replacement lock screen clock widget for Android 4.2+. It also
  exposes additional status items called extensions. The widget comes bundled with
  extensions that give you instant access to:

  * Missed calls and unread text messages
  * Your next calendar appointment
  * Your next scheduled alarm
  * Weather from choice of location

  Other extensions are available. To add the widget to your Android 4.2 device's
  lock screen, simply swipe to the left-most page of your lock screen and touch
  the "+" icon. Then, select "DashClock" to customize and add the widget. You can
  make this the primary lock screen widget, replacing the default clock, by first
  touching-and-holding it and then dragging it horizontally to the very rightmost
  position.

MaintainerNotes: |-
  MicroG's GmsLib can be used to strip play-services dependency
  for this one, according to https://github.com/microg/android_external_GmsLib#example-dashclock .

  Installing gmslib fails due to signing issues. Maybe just `gradle assembleRelease` and sign manually?
