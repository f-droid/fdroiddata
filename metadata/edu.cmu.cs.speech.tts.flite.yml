AutoName: Flite TTS Engine
Description: |-
    Flite (festival-lite) is a small, fast runtime speech synthesis engine developed
    at Carnegie Mellon University and primarily designed for small embedded devices.

    This application wraps the Flite engine so that it can be installed as an
    application on Android devices. This app gets installed as a TTS library,
    thereby allowing other applications to make use of Flite for synthesis.

    After installing this application, you will have to: 1. Enable Flite from "Text
    to Speech Settings" on your phone 2. Install voice data 3. Go to "Language"
    settings and select the voice that you want. By clicking on "Listen to a sample"
    you can verify that Flite is working.
