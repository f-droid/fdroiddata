Auto Name:My Contacts
Summary:Quickly access your contacts
Description:
Recent Contacts lets you see your recently and most called contacts in one
overview, and it lets you make direct phone calls straight from the widget
itself without launching the dialer app first. As with any widget, if you don’t
like using it, it can easily be removed.
