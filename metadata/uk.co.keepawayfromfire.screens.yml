AutoName: Screens
Description: |-
  Automatically enter split screen mode from launcher shortcuts and Quick Settings
  tiles.

  Screens allows you to quickly enter splitscreen mode with pre selected apps. It
  creates shortcuts that can be used from any launcher. This might be good for
  productivity or having SeriesGuide and Kore at the same time.

  This app uses Accessibility services. Accessibility services are required to
  enable Multi window automatically, if you don't want to provide this open source
  app with the permission you will need to manually hold the recents button when
  prompted.
