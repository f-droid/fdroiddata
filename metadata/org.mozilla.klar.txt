Summary:The privacy browser
Description:
Browse like no one’s watching. The new Firefox Klar automatically blocks a wide
range of online trackers — from the moment you launch it to the second you leave
it. Easily erase your history, passwords and cookies, so you won’t get followed
by things like unwanted ads.

Firefox Klar is a version of Firefox Focus for Germany, Austria and Switzerland
with user activity tracking disabled by default.
