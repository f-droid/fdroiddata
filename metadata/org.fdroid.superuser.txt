Summary:Manage root access
Description:
An app to allow or disallow apps' requests to run as root, like the
Superuser app that comes with custom ROMs. The difference here is
that the entire app can be built from source with the Android
SDK and NDK, including the '''su''' binary which is bundled within and
copied to /system when the prompts are followed.
You must already have root for this to work, because it leverages
the existing su and Superuser app to install itself.
However, if you know what you are doing you can use this apk
as a su/Superuser substitute if you are gaining an initial root.
Once the install is completed you can disable or remove the old app.
It should work with both ARM and x86.

We don't provide a flashable zip that could be flashed
in the event that something goes wrong. Assuming you have a
custom recovery, you can try the
Google Play description of com.koushikdutta.superuser
for a link to the developer's zip, which may need to be pushed
to /tmp via adb. Note that, because we use a different package ID
there should be no conflict between our's and his.
So, if you're not confident you can fix a bad
installation and your current Superuser isn't broken, it is probably
best to avoid it.
