AutoName: Send to Computer
Summary: Send web pages to your computer
Description: |-
    You will need [[com.google.zxing.client.android]] to be installed to use this.

    First visit [http://send-to-computer.appspot.com] on your computer and make sure
    popup blocking is disabled. Scan the barcode given on the screen (the app
    remembers the unique id at the end of the url so that it can identify your
    requests for web pages). Choose Open in Browser and choose Send to Computer (you
    may have to scroll). You are now setup and can send webpages to your computer
    via the browser share menu. The computer browser checks every two minutes for
    requests so you might have to wait a little. The source code is also available
    for the server side of things.
