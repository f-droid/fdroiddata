Auto Name:Calendar Color
Summary:Simple android app to change the calendar color
Description:
A simple open source app to change to color of a calendar in android 4+.
Tested with calendars provided by baikal.

Issues:

The color is slightly different from what the google calendar app is showing.
The google calendar app seems to tweak the colors a little bit. Colors set
in owncloud are also slightly different in the google calendar app.

The colorchanges back after some time: Many calendar services will overwrite
the color when syncing. Set the color directly in the service (e.g. google,
owncloud) instead.
