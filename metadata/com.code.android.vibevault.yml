AutoName: Vibe Vault
Description: |-
    Vibe Vault lets you browse, stream, and download from www.archive.org's
    collection of over 84,000 live concerts. Archive.org's collection spans almost
    8,000 Grateful Dead recordings, among recordings of other great bands like
    Lotus, Sound Tribe Sector 9, Yonder Mountain String Band, String Cheese
    Incident, and a huge number of other great acts.

    Vibe Vault will play your music in the background while you do other things with
    your phone. You can play whole shows at once, make playlists with songs from
    multiple shows, and download single tracks or entire concerts.

    It is designed to be fast, light on resources, attractive, and intuitive.
