AutoName: Dudo
Description: |-
    Dudo (Spanish for I doubt), also known as Cacho, Pico, Perudo or Cachito is
    popular dice game played in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and other Latin American
    countries. It is a more specific version of a family of games collectively
    called Liar's Dice, which has many forms and variants.

    This game can be played by two or more players and consists of guessing how many
    dice, placed under cups, there are on the table showing a certain number. The
    player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still
    retain a die (or dice) is the winner.
