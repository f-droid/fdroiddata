AutoName: Contact Book
Description: |-
  <i>Contactbook</i> is a simple alternative to the Google contacts app which
  won't share any information to others. It does use its own database, so
  everything is saved locally: nothing goes to any cloud, and other apps won't
  have access. Also for privacy reasons it just uses a minimal set of
  permissions: CALL_PHONE (so you can call your contacts), and CAMERA (to add
  contact photos and import contacts via QR codes).

  The app was made by Anatoli Schäfer and Marc Zintel and the project was
  given by Prof. Dr. Manh Tien Tran. The project was a part of the Master
  degrees of computer science at the Hochschule Kaiserslautern.

  <b>Features:</b>

  * Save contacts with name, numbers, emails and profilepics you can directly take
  * Own safe database. Other apps will not access to your contacts
  * QR-code scanner to import your contacs and share them to others
  * Share your own number to others on a safe way (QR-scan)
  * Simple and clear design
