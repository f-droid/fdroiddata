Auto Name:Mustard
Summary:Microblogging via StatusNet
Description:
'''The versions here don't work with Twitter or identi.ca any more'''. 
They only work with GNU Social (formerly StatusNet).
You may like to try [[org.mariotaku.twidere]] or [[org.andstatus.app]], 
for Twitter; or [[org.macno.puma]] for identi.ca.

Mustard is a full-featured client for [http://status.net Statusnet] /
GNU Social, a microblogging platform somewhat like Twitter, but
decentralized.
Note that the hitherto largest Statusnet site, [http://identi.ca identi.ca],
now uses a different platform called [http://pump.io pump.io].

It has many features like attachments, geolocation and avatar update.
It supports tags, groups and public timelines, favor/disfavor notices,
subscribe/unsubscribe users and multiple accounts.

If the server uses OAuth the credentials will need to be put
on a server as explained on the website.
