AutoName: HU Berlin Wi-Fi Installer
Description: |-
    With this app members of Humboldt University Berlin (everyone who has a
    Computer- and Media service (CMS) account) can create a WiFi profile for
    using eduroam (so without any manual WiFi configuration). This app only
    works for members of Humboldt University Berlin. If you are our guest
    please configure eduroam using the tools and manuals of your home
    institution.

    '''NOTICE:''' If you are using Android 6.0 and configuring eduroam fails,
    you have to remove your existing wifi configurations ("eduroam" and
    "eduroam_5GHz") manually.
