AutoName: HU Berlin Wi-Fi Installer
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> The University is now using another system, "eduroam"

  With this app members of Humboldt University Berlin (everyone who has a
  Computer- and Media service (CMS) account) can create a WiFi profile for
  using eduroam (so without any manual WiFi configuration). This app only
  works for members of Humboldt University Berlin. If you are our guest
  please configure eduroam using the tools and manuals of your home
  institution.

  <b>NOTICE:</b> If you are using Android 6.0 and configuring eduroam fails,
  you have to remove your existing wifi configurations ("eduroam" and
  "eduroam_5GHz") manually.
