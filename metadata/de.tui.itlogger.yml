Description: |-
  Log and evaluate data from your smartphone and OBD (onboard diagnostics).
  iTLogger is the result of a software project at Ilmenau University of Technology
  in 2012. Its aim was to create an app and corresponding desktop program (in the
  same code repository), so that people could track their journey on forest roads
  and later evaluate the data on their desktop. With the logged data you can
  evaluate the quality of forest roads.
