AutoName: Calcvac
Description: |-
  The programs calcvac/vacline can calculate logitudinal one-dimensional
  pressure profiles in vacuum pipes. The pipes can consist of different
  sections of different shape and material. Outgasing of several different
  gas species can be simulated. Also it is possible to install vacuum pumps of
  different types. Also cryo effects (cold pipes and cryo pumps) are
  simulated. Finally the pipes can be linked together to form a network.
