AutoName: Calcvac
Description: |-
    The programs calcvac/vacline can calculate logitudinal one-dimensional
    pressure profiles in vacuum pipes. The pipes can consist of different
    sections of different shape and material. Outgasing of several different
    gas species can be simulated. Also it is possible to install vacuum pumps of
    different types. Also cryo effects (cold pipes and cryo pumps) are
    simulated. Finally the pipes can be linked together to form a network.
