AutoName: X11-Basic
Description: |-
    X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
    capability. It has a very rich command set, though it is still easy to learn.
    The syntax is most similar to GFA-Basic for ATARI-ST. It is a structured dialect
    with no line numbers. A full manual and command reference is available.
    GFA-programs should run with only a few changes. Also DOS/QBASIC programmers
    will feel comfortable. This implementation is one of the fastest basic
    interpreters for Android. Programs can be compiled into a platform independant
    bytecode.
