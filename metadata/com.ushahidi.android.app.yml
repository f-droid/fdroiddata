Description: |-
    Ushahidi is a web and mobile platform that allows you to create, visualize and
    share stories on a map. It allows individuals to share their stories on their
    own terms using the tools they already have. Sync with any Ushahidi deployment.
    Send reports with images and location data as well as receive alerts from others
    who have sent in reports to the site.

    The app supports loading of multiple deployments at one time, quick filtering
    through reports, exploring incident locations on the map, viewing report photos,
    news article, media as well as sharing reports via email, SMS or Twitter. Once
    the data has been downloaded, the app can function without an internet
    connection, allowing accurate collection of data utilizing the device’s camera
    and GPS capabilities
