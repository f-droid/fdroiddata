AutoName: painlessMesh
Description: |-
  Allows to connect from Android to a
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh">painlessMesh network</a> and act
  like a node. The app can connect, request routing info (NODE_SYNC_REQUEST)
  and send single (SINGLE) and broadcast (BROADCAST) messages. There is no
  support for (TIME_DELAY), (TIME_SYNC) and (NODE_SYNC_REPLY). The app is
  connecting to the closest painlessMesh AP.

  Due to restrictions of Android, painlessMesh can not have AP and STA mode
  running in parallel. Since Android 6 it requires the location service
  permission from the user to be able to scan for Wi-Fi networks.
