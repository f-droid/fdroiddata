AutoName: Czech Diacritic Keyboard
Description: |-
  <b>App is no longer maintained.</b>

  This is modified AOSP keyboard, that features iPhone-like writing of
  diacritics. Caron an acute keys are added to the right of the keyboard
  for faster typing. The diacritic keys best fit Czech language, but are
  suitable for any language that uses them. Unfortunately auto-correction
  is broken and I am unable to fix (I tried. A lot).

  As a bonus I also added swipe control, that allows you to precisely
  navigate throughout the text.

  Main features:

  * Caron and acute keys for faster typing
  * Suitable for any language, that uses diacritics (Czech, Slovak, ...)
  * Precise navigation in text by swiping across the keyboard
  * Material design
