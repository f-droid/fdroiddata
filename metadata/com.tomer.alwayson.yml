  The idea is to provide users with information about, time, date, notifications

  * Auto movement: avoid AMOLED burn-in
  * Auto night mode: dim the screen automatically in dark environment
  * Pocket mode: lock the device when you leave it in your pocket to save battery
  * Custom watch faces: Digital S7 style, Classic 24H, Analog S7 style, Analog Pebble style and more!
  * Always On Memo: write a reminder and make it show up on your screen all the time!
  * Double tap to wake + Swipe up to wake + Volume keys to wake + Back button to wake
  * Force orientation: set your preferred screen orientation
  * Customization: change the text color, text size, font, brightness and more
  * Greenify integration: start Greenify automatically when locking the screen to save battery
