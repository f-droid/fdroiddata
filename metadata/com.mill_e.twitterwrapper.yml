AutoName: Tinfoil for Twitter
Description: |-
  Browse Twitter's mobile site with a simple web browser, which protects your
  privacy by avoiding the ability of the page and others to track your browsing
  history. It also includes other functionalities, like shortcuts to the
  notifications page or app settings to control whether your current location is
  to be provided to Twitter's website.

  The COARSE_LOCATION permission is only used if you enable "Allow Check-ins" on
  the preferences section, which is disabled by default.
