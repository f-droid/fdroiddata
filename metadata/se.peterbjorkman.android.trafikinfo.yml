Summary: Show Swedish traffic information
Description: |-
    This application shows traffic information received from Trafikverket, the
    Swedish Transport Administration.

    Requires proprietary Google Maps to be installed on your device and even then
    the maps won't be visible because F-droid can't include API keys in the build.
    If you need the maps feature try the developer build from the website.
