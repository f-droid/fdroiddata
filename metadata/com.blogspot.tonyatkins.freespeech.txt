Description:
Free Speech is a sound board for people who have problems speaking. When you
press a button, a sound is played. You can use recorded sounds, record new
sounds, or generate sounds using the text-to-speech (TTS) built-into Android.
Free Speech is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) program that
provides a low-cost alternative to dedicated speech generating devices (SGD).

Anti-feature: Tracking. Crash reports are sent without interaction.
