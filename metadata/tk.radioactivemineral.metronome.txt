Auto Name:Metronome
Summary:Use your smartphone as a metronome
Description:
Simple metronome app for musicians.

This program was born out of my frustration to find a simple, elegant and useful
metronome app, so my solution was simple: make what I want!

In addition to being a simple BPM-based metronome, the program offers the
ability to manually tap in a tempo and it also offers the option to save and
restore presets.
