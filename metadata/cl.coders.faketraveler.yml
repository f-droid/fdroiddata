AutoName: Fake Traveler
Description: Sometimes you need to fake the location of your device (for  privacy
    or to test an app). Fake Traveler provides you a map to select the location where
    you want your phone to be. Long press in the map and tap Apply button. In "..."
    button there are two options to keep  mocking the location over time. No root
    needed as it uses a developers option to mock the location in your device.
