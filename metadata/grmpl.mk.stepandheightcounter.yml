AutoName: Step and Height counter
Description: |-
    This app counts steps and elevation gain if step sensor and pressure sensor is
    available as on the Nexus 5X. It is only tested on this device, so I don’t know
    if it will run on other devices.  Please note: Pressure sensor is mandatory.
    Steps will not be counted if there is a step sensor but no pressure sensor.

    Elevation gain should only be counted if steps are detected, so only stairs will
    count, but not elevators. Don’t expect high accuracy - due to the concept of the
    sensors the accuracy is limited. And: avoid walking in trains or subways with
    active measurement, as the pressure (and therefore height) can change
    significantly during driving.

    You can save regular and daily statistics automatically on SD-Card and save a
    marker with current values with the floating action button. There isn’t much on
    graphical display of statistic data besides two progress bars. Just use any
    program which can read csv-values.

    '''Permissions:'''

    * Keep device awake: Device will not be kept awake all time. It will be woken up regulary and kept awake if necessary for short time to ensure proper counting of steps and elevation gain.
    * Write to external storage: App will work without this permission, but you cannot save statistical values or markers.
