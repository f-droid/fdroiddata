AutoName: Mixare
Description: |-
  Point the camera and see what's around. Uses a variety of sources, including
  Wikipedia , Twitter, OpenStreetMap and mixare.org. Versions after 0.9.2 are
  built from a different repository which avoids the Google Maps requirement and
  uses OSM instead. (This is not fully implemented yet).

  Google Maps don't function in the f-droid.org build, because API keys aren't in
  the source code.

  Anti-feature: Dependencies. It's necessary for Google Maps to be already
  installed either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be
  installable.

  <b>Note:</b> This app is currently not actively maintained.
