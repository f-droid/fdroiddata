Auto Name:AnaCam
Summary:Anaglyph Camera
Description:
With this app, you can easily take 3D stereoscopic "anaglyph" pictures with your
device's camera. Simply take two shots at slightly different locations, and
watch the result with red-cyan (or others) glasses! AnaCam includes a live
preview, so that you can find the best position for the second picture before
you take it.
