AutoName: OASVN Pro
Description: |-
    Works for http:// https:// and svn:// repositories. svn+ssh:// is experimental
    and has been added recently. Currently supports all of the following svn
    operations: Checkout (Head or specify revision), Update, Commit, Export (Head or
    specify revision), Cleanup, and Revert. Also allows you to view remote
    repository revisions (you specify the number of revisions to retrieve) and see
    commit comments, author, date/time and all files changed, added, deleted, etc.

    Working copies and exports of repositories are saved locally (all checked out
    files will go to your mountable storage: most of the time /mnt/sdcard/OASVN) so
    they could be edited on your device with an IDE such as Terminal IDE and then
    you can commit back to your repository.

    The most recent version adds svn export so you can make a local copy of your
    repository on your Android device without making a working svn copy.
