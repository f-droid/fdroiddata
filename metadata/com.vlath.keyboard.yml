AutoName: BeHe Keyboard
Description: |-
  With BeHe Keyboard you can enjoy programming and using special keys (such as
  CTRL and ALT) on your android device without forgetting the design. You can
  switch between keyboard faces with a simple press of a button, so it's easy to
  use BeHe Keyboard as your main keyboard. The app features three keyboard faces
  (QWERTY, so you can use it for regular typing, Arrow Keys, so you can use it in
  the terminal, and Programming for, well, programming). There are multiple themes
  for the app with more to be added in the future. You can also select which
  keyboard to display first.
