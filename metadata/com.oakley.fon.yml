    The FON network is made up of routers that share their internet access with

    partners.

    Based on the no longer maintained [[com.sputnik.wispr]].

    '''Features:'''

    * Free Wi-Fi access for members of Fon and its partners
    * Automatically connect to the Fon network whenever a Fon Wi-Fi hotspot is detected
    * Test the speed of the network you are connected to.
    * Save hotspots areas for offline navigation
