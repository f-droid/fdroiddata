Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

  This app plays internet radio streams. The app is a fork of the WebRadio
  app - but with a changed editor, a focus on rock music and a comic
  music visualization. The design of the app has been renewed and some
  new features and corrections have been added (night mode, power
  saving, Notification Channel since android 8). By modifying the code
  a backwards compatibility back to Android 4.1 was reached.
