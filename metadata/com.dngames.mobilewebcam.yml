AutoName: MobileWebCam
Description: |-
  Use your Android as a simple mobile webcam or cloudcam via WIFI or Mobile
  Network. Upload pics with ftp or store on your sdcard to create a timelapse
  video (the http and email options may not work in this build though).

  Use as simple but mobile timed webcam with refresh rates from seconds to hours,
  with motion detection or your defined daily activity times. High resolution
  pictures are also possible. Mark the pictures with text or image to advertise
  for your place or business.

  Requires root: No. You will need root to use the feature that auto-reboots the
  app after a certain number of pictures.
