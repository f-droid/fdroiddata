Name: Ellaism Wallet
AutoName: Ellaism Wallet
Description: |-
  Ellaism has zero pre-mine and has no mandatory developer fees with all support
  and development donated freely by the community. We believe this makes our coin
  one of the most honest pure Ethereum projects, and something that is uniquely
  interesting as a platform for serious developers, educators, and enthusiasts.

  The Ellaism Wallet is based on a fork of Lunary Ethereum Wallet, an open source
  secure wallet for Android.
