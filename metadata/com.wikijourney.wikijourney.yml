Description: |-
  This app has been deprecated in favor of https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.wikijourney.wikijourney.

  <a href="https://www.wikijourney.eu/">WikiJourney</a> is an app that allows tourists to
  visit a town with Wikipedia information. The app looks around the user for the
  points of interest, lists them, then creates a custom trail according to the
  user's likes and the time he has.

  Features:

  * Find POIs around me: the app locates you, and the automatically searches on English Wikipedia the available POIs.
  * Map display: once you have been located, the app displays your location with every POIs around you on a map. By tapping one of these points, a bubble displays more information, and links to the Wikipedia article.
  * List of POIs: a screen gathers every POIs found by the app, for a fast and easy interaction.
