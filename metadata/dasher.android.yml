AutoName: Dasher
Description: |-
  Dasher is an information-efficient, text-entry interface, driven by a natural
  continuous steering of the cursor into boxes representing the letter you want to
  input.

  Dasher is especially useful for text-entry wherever a full-size keyboard cannot
  be used — for example,

  * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse;
  * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by eyetracker);
  * on a palmtop computer;
  * on a wearable computer.
