Summary:Public transport routing
Description:
A public transport app that works mostly in Europe, but also in California, Philadelphia, Sydney and other places.

It finds connections from your home, current position or given station to wherever you want to go.
Locations are automatically saved and shown with the most used on top.
You can also save entire connections as favorites and find next trips with one click.

The app can find nearby stations and show upcoming departures including the delays (if there are any).
