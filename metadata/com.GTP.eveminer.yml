AutoName: EVE Mining Calc
Description: |-
    This simple app let’s you select some ores and will fetch their prices in
    Tradehubs. Then it will display them sorted by your profit so you don’t have to
    worry about things like checking their prices, volumes and calculating your
    profit. You can also specify systems: Telling the app that you are in a 0.7
    Gallente system will make it display only the ores that are avaible there.
