AutoName: BART Runner
Description: |-
  Enter your most traveled routes and receive a real-time listing of upcoming
  departures.

  * Streamlined for experienced BART commuters
  * Real-time departure info refreshes automatically, and the accuracy of the departure estimates increases over time
  * Estimated arrival times
  * Pick which train you want to board, and information about that departure will be available in your notification tray
  * Set a departure alarm to go off a few minutes before your train leaves (you pick how much advance warning you want)
  * Phone will not sleep while viewing departure times (the screen will only dim), so you only need a quick glance at the phone to see how long you have left to catch the train
  * Zoomable offline system map
  * Fares and next departure time are shown in the saved route listing

  There may be an issue with crashes on the Galaxy S: the author is working hard
  on a fix.

  Tracking AntiFeature as it comes with Sentry which cannot be disabled.
