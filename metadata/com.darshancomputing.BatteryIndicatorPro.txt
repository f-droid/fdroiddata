Auto Name:BatteryBot
Summary:Battery monitoring tool, "pro" version
Description:
Shows your battery charge level (percent) as an icon in your status bar, with
temperature, health, voltage, and time since plugged / unplugged in the
notification area. It also has user-configurable alarms, logs, and widgets.

* Automatic time-remaining estimates based on recent usage
* Several icon sets (including fully configurable green, amber, red, and black icons)
* Small (1x1) and large (4x1) app widgets
* Notification (with status bar icon) is now optional -- can be used as just a desktop widget
* Battery logging. You can log the battery state (charge, status, voltage, temperature) and browse the logs on the phone or export to CSV.
* Manually or automatically disable / re-enable device lock screen / lockscreen / keyguard
* Alarms (full, charge above X, charge below X, temperature above X, or health failure)
* Control the notification priority on Android 4.1+ (For example, you can set to "minimum" to hide the icon but keep the notification in the tray.)
