AutoName: EPUB3 Reader
Description: |-
    '''NOTE:''' This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

    The goal of this project consists in exploring new ways of interacting with
    rich, structured eBooks in EPUB format.

    The rationale behind this choice is simple:

    * EPUB is an open format for eBooks and it is the de facto standard for non-Amazon eBooks
    * The current reading systems (eReaders, desktop programs, apps) are not suitable for reading structured, complex eBooks, as they are almost always designed with linear-reading books in mind.
