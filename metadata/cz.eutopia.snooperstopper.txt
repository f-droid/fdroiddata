Auto Name:SnooperStopper
Summary:Set different boot and unlock passwords
Description:
Allows you to create a different encryption password for booting your device
than unlocking your screen. This allows you to have a stronger device encryption
password (which you only need to enter once after booting your device) and a
simpler pattern/PIN/password for unlocking your screen.

If an attacker tries to guess your simple pattern/PIN/password, he has only few
tries (default is 3) after which the device is rebooted and he needs to enter
your strong device encryption password again.

Root privileges required.
