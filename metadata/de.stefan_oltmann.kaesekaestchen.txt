Summary:Classic puzzle game
Description:
Players take turns joining two horizontally or vertically adjacent dots by a
line. A player that completes the fourth side of a square (a box) colors that
box and must play again. When all boxes have been colored, the game ends and the
player who has colored more boxes wins. You are playing against the computer.
The computer is red; you are blue.
