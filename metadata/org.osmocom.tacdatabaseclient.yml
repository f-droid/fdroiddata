AutoName: TAC Database Client
Description: |-
  This project aims to provide a publicly, community-maintained, and
  well-organized database to collect Type Allocation Codes (TACs). While other
  databases exist, they either don't provide the full data set (e.g. by providing
  a query interface with rate limiting) or are not maintained in a way that we
  consider helps the community (submission process cumbersome, data not
  cleaned/sanitized,...).

  What is a TAC?

  A Type Allocation Code (TAC) is made up by the first 8 digits of the so-called
  International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) associated with mobile
  devices. Earlier versions of the 3GPP TS 03.03 specification defined it as 6
  bytes. The TAC is a unique identifier to determine the device manufacturer/model
  and its marketing name. These records are allocated by certain groups and a full
  list of all IMEIs is maintained by the GSMA.
