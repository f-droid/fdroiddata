Summary:Install fonts for Georgian script
Description:
Install Georgian fonts if you don't have them already.
Fonts have an AOSP base with added glyphs from
[http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/index.php?title=Besarion_Gugushvili DejaVu].
Installation will overwrite the default fonts that you already have
and make a backup of them.
If it doesn't work maybe you don't have S-OFF or are
currently using a non-default font. Reboot after installation.
The suggested log application isn't free so use
[[org.jtb.alogcat]] instead.

Requires root: Yes. Android fonts are always located in /system
.
