AutoName: Units
Description: |-
  A powerful unit-aware calculator and converter inspired by GNU Units.

  It can convert between ≈2,400 different units, making it an ideal unit converter
  for complex or obscure tasks. It has everything - from basic distances, volumes
  and temperatures, to kitchen weight-to-volume conversions, to chemistry- and
  physics-specific units and equations.

  Units can convert between dimensions, for example, multiplying distances to get
  area and volume.
