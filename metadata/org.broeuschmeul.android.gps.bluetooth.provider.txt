Auto Name:BlueGps
Summary:Connect a GPS via bluetooth
Description:
Allows the connection of an external GPS tracker/mouse via bluetooth, injecting the location data as a “mock provider”. This can provide more accurate location than the build-in receiver (very useful for tracking in dense areas or in the woods, esp. for small tracks or streetaddresses etc), as well as make it possible to use GPS inside a car/boot, where the GPS receiver is mounted outside to get better reception.
