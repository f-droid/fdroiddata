Auto Name:Corporate Addressbook
Summary:Lookup Exchange GAL for contacts
Description:
The Global Address List (GAL) lookup available in Android is limited in
functionality. It only looks up the email address and does not provide other
information that is available in the GAL. This application looks up the GAL and
returns ALL data that is available on the Exchange server for the query.
