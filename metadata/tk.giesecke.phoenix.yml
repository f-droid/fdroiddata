Description: |-
  Reboot your phone in a given interval on a specific time and start a specific
  application after reboot. The idea is to restart Android and an application
  periodically to clean up cache and memory leaks if the application has to run
  over a long time.

  And if you don't need to restart an application, still this can help to close
  memory leaks. No background services - reboot is scheduled by system
  AlarmManager. Before reboot is applied, all apps get a shutdown call to save
  there data. This helps to prevent data loss!

  Configuration allows

  * selection of reboot interval from every day to every 30 days
  * selection of reboot time from midnight to 11pm
  * selection between hard reboot (complete restart) or soft/hot reboot (only restart apps)
  * selection if you want to start an app automatically after reboot
  * selection of any app to be started automatically after reboot
