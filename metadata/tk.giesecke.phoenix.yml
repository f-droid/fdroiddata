Description: |-
    Reboot your phone in a given interval on a specific time and start a specific
    application after reboot. The idea is to restart Android and an application
    periodically to clean up cache and memory leaks if the application has to run
    over a long time.

    And if you don't need to restart an application, still this can help to close
    memory leaks. No background services - reboot is scheduled by system
    AlarmManager. Before reboot is applied, all apps get a shutdown call to save
    there data. This helps to prevent data loss!

    Configuration allows

    * selection of reboot interval from every day to every 30 days
    * selection of reboot time from midnight to 11pm
    * selection between hard reboot (complete restart) or soft/hot reboot (only restart apps)
    * selection if you want to start an app automatically after reboot
    * selection of any app to be started automatically after reboot
