AutoName: Word Power Made Easy
Description: |-
  Vocabulary building with hundreds of word meanings chosen carefully from various
  SAT, GRE and GMAT course materials.

  You will get random words from a very big offline in-app dictionary. You have to
  guess the meaning of the word in 1 second otherwise the app will show it to you.
  So you need to be fast. You can tap anywhere to get the next word.
