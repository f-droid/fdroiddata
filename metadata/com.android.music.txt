Summary:The stock audio player
Description:
The stock Android music player; the version name corresponds to the tag at
which it was built. 
Although the interface hasn't changed since the Gingerbread days, the code
has got a steady stream of bug-fixes and translations.
It is good for playing streams and audio files from the file manager.
