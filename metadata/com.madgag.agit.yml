AutoName: Agit
Description: |-
  Clone remote git repositories onto your phone!

  * Just like regular Git, the full history is stored for offline access.
  * Animated Diffs - Watch diffs smoothly transition from Before to After.
  * Supports git, http, https protocols. SSH for private repos is also possible
  * Periodic sync enabled on Android 2.3 and later: latest commits fetched quarter-hourly.

  Currently this is a 'read-only' client. You can clone & fetch, but not commit
  and push.
