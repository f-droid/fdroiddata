AutoName: Snooder 21
Description: |-
    Snooder 21 is a remake of the very popular Motorola’s standard card game Snood™
    21 for Android.

    Snooder 21 uses SurfaceView Canvas for drawing videocontext of the game. I added
    touch controls and some game engine improvements: launcher, drag and drop cards,
    sounds, etc.
