Name: Rotation Lock + Landscape
AutoName: Rotation Lock+Landscape
Description: |-
  Turn on/off Auto-rotate screen quickly by long pressing search button.

  When you are lying on bed. The screen changes to landscape. Have to open system
  settings to disable Auto-rotate screen. Did you find it is really inconvenient?
  This app provides a super easy way for switching this setting. And it provides a
  state icon to indicate the current setting.

  Fork of https://f-droid.org/packages/org.penghuang.tools.rotationlock.
