AutoName: Remembeer
Description: |-
    Remembeer lets you track and rate the beers you drink. No more trying to
    remember the name of that microbrew from last night, quickly check your log and
    see what you thought.

    Anti-feature: Network Services. The Beer Cloud - online database to which the
    app connects for info - is neither free-as-in-freedom nor open-source, but that
    behaviour can be disabled in the settings
