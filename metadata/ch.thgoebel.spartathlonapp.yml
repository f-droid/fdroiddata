Description: |-
    This app aims to help athletes, supporters and volunteers during the ultra distance race Spartathlon.

    * Search through the list of the athletes who compete(d) in the current year.
    * Display your favourite athletes directly on the dashboard
    * Dark theme (easier on the eyes if you're waiting for your athlete in Nestani)
