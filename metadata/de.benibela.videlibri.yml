Name: VideLibri
AutoName: VideLibri
Summary: A client for (German) public libraries
Description: |-
    VideLibri watches over the books you have lend in public libraries. It will
    automatically renew the loan period, warn you if some books are due, and keep a
    history of all ever lend books. You can also search new books in the catalog and
    order the found books. It has been tested with over 100 libraries in
    Germany/Austria/Switzerland.

    A custom programming language based on XQuery with pattern matching and a
    corresponding interpreter have been developed for VideLibri, so you can add
    support for any existing library without changing anything in the App itself.
    Due to the pattern matching many libraries can be added by inserting annotations
    on downloaded library webpages without writing any source in the custom
    programming language, too.
