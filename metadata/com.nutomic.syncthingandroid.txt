Auto Name:Syncthing
Summary:File synchronization
Description:
This is the first attempt at an Android port of syncthing. Please understand
that this is not stable yet, and read the first start dialog carefully.

Syncthing replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open,
trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to
choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it's
transmitted over the Internet.
