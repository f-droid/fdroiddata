Description: |-
  As a minimalistic workout tracker SWJ is designed for those who know what they
  want and who are concentrated on results. You will not find predefined
  description for routines or any other amateur targeted features here. It is
  similar to simple sheet of paper where you write down exercises with repetitions
  and sets you have performed.

  It consists of two synced lists: one for exercises you have performed, and the
  second for sets you have done. Also has the ability to write down a note for an
  exercise or set -- and here we are: Maximal informativity with minimum of
  interactions.

  Additionally you can create report for chosen exercise with graph and some
  stats.
