Summary:Powerful unit converter
Description:
A powerful unit-aware calculator and converter inspired by GNU Units.

It can convert between ≈2,400 different units, making it an ideal unit converter
for complex or obscure tasks. It has everything - from basic distances, volumes
and temperatures, to kitchen weight-to-volume conversions, to chemistry- and
physics-specific units and equations.

Units can convert between dimensions, for example, multiplying distances to get
area and volume.
