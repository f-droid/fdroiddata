Auto Name:Twidere
Summary:Microblogging  client
Description:
Features include:
* Built in image viewer and map viewer
* Direct messages with conversation style
* Extension support like Twicca, but more friendly for users and developers
* t.co link auto expanding
* Multiple account support
* Custom oAuth consumer key/secret
* Basic features supported for StatusNet/Fanfou
* Direct login with user name and password (Don't worry! It's safe!)
* Custom API Proxy (gtap, twip, jtapi supported)
* GZip compressing for API requests
* TCP DNS query and custom host mapping to fight against censorship

Development is focussed on Twitter and that service is the only one officially
supported.
Versions prior to 0.2.0 use Twitter API v1.0.

If you want a StatusNet account press the button at the top of the account
setup page.
Set an appropriate REST API url and choose basic authentication.
Searches will go to Twitter by default.
For general info about the StatusNet API see
[http://status.net/wiki/Twitter-compatible_API their wiki].

You can donate via PayPal here, with the same address being used for AliPay
donations.

Status: We can't build the latest versions as we only get build errors.
