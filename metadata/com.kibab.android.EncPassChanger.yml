AutoName: EncPassChanger
Description: |-
  In Android 4.0.3+ it is now possible to encrypt the storage so that a password
  is necessary to decrypt it every time the phone is switched on. However, in
  stock Android, the password used to generate the encryption key is identical to
  that used to unlock the screen. That either forces you to use weak password, or
  to type long secure password each time you unlock the screen of device. This
  application uses standard VDC calls to validate and set a new password. The app
  has been tested on the developer's Galaxy Nexus: however, please backup your
  data before using this app! If you forget your password, you will NEVER recover
  your data!
