Auto Name:RetroArch
Summary:Modular multi-system emulator
Description:
RetroArch is a modular multi-system game/emulator system that is designed to be fast, 
lightweight, and portable. It allows emulator developers to implement their emulators as special 
libraries (RetroArch cores) to target wide range of platforms, including game consoles and mobile 
devices, without writing any platform-specific code.

Latest F-Droid build supports following systems:

* Play Station 1 with PCSX ReARMed core (ARMv7 only)

Anti-features: Addons. This build does not include non-free components, but majority of cores, 
included in official .apk, have non-free licenses or contain proprietary parts.

# There may be newer versions, including ones with support for other CPU architectures, but I
