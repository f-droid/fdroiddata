Auto Name:Location Cache Map
Summary:Where was your device?
Description:
N.B Only applies if you are on Android 2.3.3-. Requires root.

If you opt-in to Network location, the non-free software provided by Google to
every Android phone, a log will be kept of your location so that Google can
benefit from the combination of location data and wireless signal data.

The log can't be viewed against a map within the app because an API key for
Google Maps is missing from the f-droid.org build and no other map source is
available. Another app that supports OpenStreetMap and gpx files can be used
to view it, such as [[me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker]].

Anti-feature: Dependency. It's necessary for Google Maps to be already installed
either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be installable.
