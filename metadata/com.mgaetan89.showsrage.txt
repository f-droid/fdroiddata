Auto Name:ShowsRage
Summary:Manage your SickRage installation
Description:
ShowsRage is an application that allows you to manage your
[https://www.sickrage.tv/ SickRage] installation.

Support for [http://www.sickbeard.com/ SickBeard] (or any other variant) is not
guaranteed, but the main features should work properly.

ShowsRage intend to provide the same features as on the web interface, packed
inside a modern and easy-to-use Android application.

The following features are currently available:

* Support Android 4.0.3 and up
* Based on [https://www.google.com/design/ Material Design]
* Shows information: list, get info, list seasons and episodes
* Shows management: add, pause/resume, change quality, delete
* Episode management: search, set status, stream, list coming
* Logs
* Shows statistics
* Update SickRage (requires SickRage 4.0.30)

The dependency on Google Play Services has been removed in this binary, but this
prevents Casting from working.
