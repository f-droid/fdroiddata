AutoName: Hydra Slayer
Description: |-
  Hydra Slayer is a roguelike game where combat has been inspired by some
  mathematical puzzles about brave heroes slaying many headed beasts. This might
  look like a standard dungeon crawler, but the puzzle element is important, and
  the later game is meant to be challenging.
