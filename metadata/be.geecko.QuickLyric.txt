Summary:Fetch and display song lyrics
Description:
QuickLyric fetches your lyrics for you. It includes a search engine and is
simple and easy to use. It can also detect what song is playing on your
device.

The NFC permission is used to share lyrics via Android Beam.

be available with [[com.geecko.QuickLyric]].
