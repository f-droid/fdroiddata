AutoName: Complica4
Description: |-
  <i>Complica4</i> is a modified version for four players of the game <i>Complica,</i>
  which is similar to the game Connect Four. In Complica (not like in Connect
  Four), when a piece is placed, it does not remain there for the entire game.
  Another piece may be used to slide the entire row over. Winner is first person
  to have 4 pieces in a row. The mechanic of the sliding rows means that each
  player can possibly have 4 in a row at the same time, causing the game to
  continue until this situation can be broken up.
