AutoName: SIP Switch
Description: |-
  Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and newer has a built in SIP/VoIP client. The widget
  has two buttons: The left one gives you a shortcut to the SIP settings i.e. to
  enable incoming calls. The second one allows you to select how calls should be
  routed primarily: you can select whether all calls should be made via SIP by
  default; only Internet calls via SIP (Airplane mode), or if you want to be asked
  before each call.
