AutoName: OI Flashlight
Description: |-
  OI Flashlight is a simple and effective application that helps you find a way in
  the dark. OI Flashlight locks the display backlight on, clearly illuminating the
  surrounding area.

  For devices with a camera flash, OI Flashlight can also use the flash as a
  bright torch to brighten the room. The color of the backlight is completely
  customizable with OI Color Picker.
