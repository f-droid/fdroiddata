Description: |-
    It's possible to embed small amount of media (like audioclips or javascript
    games) physically on paper as 2d QR barcodes. This is unlike current usage of QR
    codes, where it is normally used to just store plaintext or urls or contacts.

    1. First objective is to decode data URIs sent in via intent from a scanner like
    [[com.google.zxing.client.android]] or from a NFC tag reader.

    2. Secondary objective, is that for larger files, you want to spread it over
    multiple QR codes. So we'll need a way to read all these tags an then join it
    together.

    Only the first part is done at the moment.
