company. You can generate reports based by filtering your time registrations by
date (pre-defined date ranges or a custom date range) and by project and task.

* Widget to start/stop a time registration
* Notifications
* Backup to SD-card
* Detailed reports for your list of time registrations
* Export those details to the CSV format
* Split time registrations
