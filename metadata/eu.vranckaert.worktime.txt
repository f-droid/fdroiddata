Auto Name:WorkTime
Summary:Tracks your work time
Description:
Worktime is for workers that need to keep track of their jobs;
whether you are working on different projects for different clients or just
one project for one company.
You can generate reports based by filtering your time registrations by date
(pre-defined date ranges or a custom date range) and by project and task.

* Widget to start/stop a time registration
* Notifications
* Backup to SD-card 
* Detailed reports for your list of time registrations
* Export those details to the CSV format 
* Split time registrations

Google analytics was removed; it's likely that future versions will rely on
proprietary libraries for Google location services so it may not be easy 
to keep the app up to date.
