AutoName: Clash of Balls
Description: |-
  Prove your sensitive control skills and compete with your friends over WiFi in
  various levels. Try to destroy your rivals by pushing them into the black void
  and become the true master of balls. Don't forget to make use of the mighty
  power-ups that will appear eventually. And always be aware of the danger that
  you have to face out there. But remember, you are alone and there is only one
  survivor.

  Games are played peer-to-peer; so no server is used, but each player needs to be
  in the same network to see each other. If the device supports it, Clash of Balls
  should also run via Bluetooth. For the best game experience, the WiFi needs low
  latencies. You can also create a Hotspot and let others connect.

  The aim of the game is to bounce the other players out of the field by balancing
  your device.The game should be self-explanatory, there is a Help Menu. When the
  game starts and the countdown is shown, hold your device still in the desired
  position, where your ball should not move. During the game, tilt the device to
  move your player to a certain direction.

  For physics simulation, JBox2D is used, a Java implementation of the 2D physics
  engine Box2D.
