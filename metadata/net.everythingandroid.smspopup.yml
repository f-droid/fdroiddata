AutoName: SMS Popup
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> App repo is archived by dev. It is read-only for all users and it is no longer actively maintained.

  Intercepts incoming text messages and displays them in a popup window. The popup
  window shows the contact the message came from and their contact photo (if there
  is one) as well as the content of the message. Directly from the popup the user
  is given the option to Close the popup (marking the message read) or Reply to
  the message (using a system intent).

  A full notifications system is included: this allows a user to disable the built
  in messaging app notifications and use those from SMS Popup. The notifications
  system has additional options such as custom vibrate pattern, custom LED color
  and the ability to remind the user of a missed message in case they missed the
  notification the first time it played.
