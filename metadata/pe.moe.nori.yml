AutoName: Nori
Summary: Online gallery viewer
Description: |-
    This app has been deprecated in favor of [[io.github.tjg1.nori]] from the same
    author.

    Connect to Danbooru image galleries and browse by tags (A swipe from the side
    reveals the action bar).

    The safebooru.org site is preloaded which shows Anime images that are considered
    'safe for work'. Note that the images there are usually of high quality and
    though the app is fast, a lot of data will be downloaded.
