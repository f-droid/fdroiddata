AutoName: Focal
Description: |-
  Fully featured camera app supporting as many devices as possiblee, including
  device-specific features on some devices.

  Features:

  * A photo and video mode, supporting many features (burst mode, timer mode, scene mode, shutter speed on Sony devices, ...)
  * A panorama mode, currently semi-broken
  * A PicSphere mode, open-source replacement of Google's PhotoSphere, to do 360° sphere shots
  * A review drawer, by sliding from the top of the screen (in portrait). It shows your latest pictures.

  In photo mode, you also have access to a few tools, such as automatic picture
  enhancement (auto-awesome), or a rule of thirds overlay. On some devices,
  settings such as Color adjustment, HDR and a manual light measure point are also
  available. Double tapping the screen will put your in quick shot mode, where
  tapping the screen anywhere will take a picture. In video mode, high-framerate
  video is also possible.
