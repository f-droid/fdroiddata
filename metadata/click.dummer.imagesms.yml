Description: |
  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

  Image SMS uses long text SMS to send a very small picture (NOT MMS or Internet). It uses base64 technique (similar to a email attachment) to transfer data. It is a bare metal App and Open Source on github. If you want to enlarge the features, you have to do it by your own!

  I love my privacy. Thus I love apps with only a couple of permissions. Image SMS needs only access on:

  * SMS (read and send)
  * Camera

  Image SMS does not use access to:

  * Files
  * Contacts
  * Internet

  This may be strange to you, because you need a phone number and there is no contact selection.
