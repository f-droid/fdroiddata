Auto Name:Beauty Clock
Summary:Pictures of people with the time
Description:
Bijin Tokei is a genre of wallpaper that is popular in East Asia.
Every minute the wallpaper changes to a picture of a pretty girl
holding an object that displays the time.

This app will download the pictures for every minute from your chosen
site without caching them ''but'' it will check if images already exist
in '''sdcard/BeautyClock/pic/site/''' and the scheme is always aabb.jpg
where aa is the hour and bb is the minute.
In this way, you can have the app display any images that you want.
