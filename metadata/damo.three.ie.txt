Description:
For pre-pay customers of 3 Ireland: fetches and displays your 
My3 3pay usage information. 

It can work when you are on 3's GSM network and also when on Wi-Fi.
You can choose whether to go through an intermediate server (run by the
author, but source code is published) to speed things up over cellular.
The app requires your My3 username and password; the app shows how
to set up an account and provides a way for obtaining your SIM serial.
