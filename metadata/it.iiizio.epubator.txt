Auto Name:ePUBator
Summary:Offline PDF to ePUB convertor
Description:
* Extracts text from a PDF file and puts it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.
* PDF extraction is based on iText library http://itextpdf.com/ released under the AGPL license.
* Doesn't need internet connection.
* Doesn't send your docs somewhere on the net.
* Extracts text (no text in pictures or in raster PDF).
* Tries to extract images (only png, jpg and gif) but puts them at the page's end.
* Tries to extract the table of contents if present (or creates a dummy TOC).
* Doesn't extract the font size and style.
* Works fine with single column PDF (can work bad with multi column or tables).
* Can fail extraction (5 of 358 books with v0.8.1 on the author's Atrix).
* IS MADE FOR BOOKS, NOT FOR EVERY TYPE OF PDF (DON'T ASK IT TOO MUCH).

In the event of crash, unexpected stoppages or insufficient memory try setting
Page per file to 1
and/or disable the extraction of images and try again (sometimes helps).
