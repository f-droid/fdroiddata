Auto Name:SVG redirect
Summary:Open SVG files with your browser
Description:
By default Android can't handle SVG files, when you try to open them from a file
manager. A Browser could handle SVG, but the most of them don't allow to call
SVG files from a file manager. SVG redirect makes that possible.
