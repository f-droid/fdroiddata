<b>All-in-one app for public transit</b>

🚍 <b>trip planner</b> (door to door),
⏱️ live <b>departure times</b> (including delays),
📌 <b>nearby stations</b> (also on a map) and
🗺️ interactive <b>network plans</b>.

Offi makes use of official time table and connection data of the selected public transit authority! This ensures that disruptions become visible as soon as the transit authority has included them with the data.


<b>Requested permissions</b>

🔸 Full network access, because Offi needs to query information services for departures and disruptions.
🔸 Location, so Offi can show nearby stations and navigate you from your current location.

Other than that, Offi will not use your private data.
