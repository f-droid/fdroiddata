AutoName: Monkeyboard Keystone Radio
Description: |-
    ''Monkeyboard Keystone Radio'' interfaces with a Monkeyboard and provides a
    control and feedback interface for the user. The Monkeyboard communicates
    via USB serial, and so to use the board a USB Host cable is required to
    connect the board to the Android device. The app is designed to act as if
    it is a normal music player as so will act accordingly. Audio focus will be
    followed, and a mediaplayer notification is provided.

    The Monkeyboard does not transmit audio over the USB connection, it is only
    outputted directly from the board itsself. The user will need to mix this
    audio with the tablet audio externally (think of the Android device as
    being a screen for the Monkeyboard).
