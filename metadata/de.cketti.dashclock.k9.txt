Auto Name:K-9 Mail DashClock Extension
Summary:Email info on the lockscreen
Description:
[[net.nurik.roman.dashclock]] extension that displays the number of
unread emails from [[com.fsck.k9]], from your choice of accounts.

Marking messages as read in K-9 won't reliably update the unread count 
if you are using v4.201 of K-9 — current versions of K-9 should work fine.
