Auto Name:PhotoBackup
Summary:Upload photos on-the-fly
Description:
Always running silently in background, this service sends photos to the associated
server as soon as you take them. An upload journal allows you to see the status of
each photo in your device. It does not backup videos.

A [https://github.com/PhotoBackup/server-bottle server implementation] is also
available.
