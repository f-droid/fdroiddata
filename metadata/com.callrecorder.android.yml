AutoName: Call recorder for Android
Description: |-
  Records all incoming and outgoing calls from/to your phone. Your calls are saved
  in mp3 format and can be sent by various methods.

  The main application screen contains a list of all calls with details of phone
  numbers, date and time of a call. A click on one of the items will provide you
  with 3 options: erase record, send record and play record.

  In order to allow or disallow recordings open the main menu and choose
  enable/disable recordings.

  This is a fork of the discontinued https://f-droid.org/packages/com.call.recorder. The fork should work
  with newer devices based on Android 4.1 and above.
