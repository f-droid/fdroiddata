Description: |-
  Note: THIS PROJECT IS ABANDONED
  Android 8 disallows any app to draw over notification panel or navigation buttons, so Pixel Filter cannot work properly on any newer phone, and nothing can be done about that.

  Current bugs:
  * Add Poisson-disc sampling algorithm for lulz.
  * Option to start on battery percentage.
  * Fix crashes when watching light level and rotating the phone.
  * Diagonal lines on some devices - auto-calibrate bitmap offset using a screenshot.
  * Filter does not cover navigation buttons fully when the keyboard is shown.
