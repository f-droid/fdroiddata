Description: |-
  Produce Chrome ARChon Custom Runtime packages directly from your phone. You can
  generate chrome packages from either APKs on your phones storage or from already
  installed apps.

  Open the App, select an APK or App from list. App Name and package name are both
  pulled from the APK and put into the manifest.json file. Everything is then
  zipped together in a ChromeAPK folder on your phones storage.
