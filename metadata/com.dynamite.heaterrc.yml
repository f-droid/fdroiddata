AutoName: HeaterRC
Description: |-
  Some vendors of independent vehicle heater allow you to remote control them via
  simple text messages. This app allows you to send commands like "start" and
  "stop", as well as querying the device for the current temperature.

  It should work with Eberspaecher and Webasto heaters, but others might work as
  well.
