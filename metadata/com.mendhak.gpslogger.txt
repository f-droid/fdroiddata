Auto Name:GPSLogger
Summary:Battery efficient GPS Logger
Description:
GPSLogger uses the GPS capabilities of your device to log coordinates to
a GPX or KML file at regular
intervals. This can be particularly useful if you want to geotag your photos
after a day out or share your
travel route with someone. The purpose of this application is to save you battery
power when abroad and to last as long as possible.

Unfortunately the app will crash if you attempt to upload tracks to
Dropbox, Google or OSM as keys
for these services aren't in the source code. Email is OK, and it works
with with one press as long as the SMTP server details are all entered correctly.
FTP functionality has been recently introduced.
