AutoName: PhoneFoneFun
Description: |-
  A simple play phone/fone for young children. Makes accurate phone noises and can
  also speak using Text-to-speech. I've tested with my own 2.5 year-old, and he
  loves it!

  Creates a standard "old-school" cell phone which can beep like a real phone, say
  numbers and make a fake conversation (using text-to-speech).
