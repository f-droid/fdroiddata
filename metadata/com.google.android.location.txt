Name:µg UnifiedNlp for GAPPS-free devices (legacy)
Auto Name:µg UnifiedNlp
Summary:Location provider middleware (UnifiedNlp)
Description:
This package is for AOSP from 2.3 to 4.3, if you use modern ROM, AOSP from 4.4
to 5.0, see [[org.microg.nlp]] or [[com.google.android.gms]].

Some ROMs, like FirePhoneOS 1.8 (AOSP 4.2), come with support for Google
geolocation provider as user app. On these systems Legacy build of UnifiedNlp
can be installed to use as the network location provider, like Google's one. It
acts as a middleware for various plugins aka backends, it does not provide any
location lookup itself. For further information please refer to the
[[com.google.android.gms]] package and the
[https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/blob/HEAD/README.md
README].

After installing you have to reboot your device, install a backend service and
activate/configure it in the app settings. After this you can use UnifiedNlp by
activating network-based geolocation from Settings -> Personal -> Location
access: You need to enable "Access to my location" and "Wi-Fi & mobile network
location".
