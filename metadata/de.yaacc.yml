    After a few years of silence Yaacc is back! The App allows you to play media
    from UPNP/DLNA devices in your network on your android device or any capable
    UPNP/DLNA device in your network. It is also possible to start an UPNP/DLNA
    server on your device in order to play media from your device on any UPNP/DLNA
    renderer in your network.

    Features:

    * UPNP/DLNA Server
    * UPNP/DLNA Client
    * UPNP/DLNA Controller
    * Control multiple media receivers
    * Multiple Receivers
    * Allow download files to the device
