Auto Name:Serval Mesh
Summary:Peer to peer communications
Description:
'''The Serval Project is seeking funds to develop a mesh extender which 
aims to work around the limitations caused by the lack of AdHoc mode in 
Android. Visit the campaign website to''' 
[http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/speak-freely support the cause].

'''N.B''' The app no longer asks for root by default although you can still
try it in adhoc mode. Prebuilts are no longer in the source code.

This is '''experimental software''': it may not work as advertised. 
It may lose or alter messages and files that it carries;
it may consume a lot of space, speed and battery, and it may crash unexpectedly.
To avail of the maps feature a separate app has to be installed which isn't
in the f-droid.org repo yet.

Mobile communications are useful, but depend on infrastructure that can be
damaged, overwhelmed,
or even absent. This app assumes zero infrastructure. The phones talk to each
other using WiFi;
relaying calls and messages and figuring out how to resolve numbers. In other
words, it lets your phone
communicate with other Android phones running Serval Mesh within WiFi range.

Requires root: No. Basic Android still doesn't allow WiFi in AdHoc mode,
so the app will ask for root if you try to enable adhoc mode. 

The Java/XML part is distributable under the GNU GPLv3 while the serval-dna
project is GPLv2.
