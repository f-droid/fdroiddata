Description: |-
  Simple fixed-point decimal arithmetic, Reverse Polish Notation calculator. RPN
  calculators may be in the minority but they are easy to learn and very
  efficient. The idea is that the operator follows the operands, so that instead
  of typing 2 + 2 =, one types 2 enter 2 enter +. The left arrow either deletes
  the last digit or drops the last item from the stack. The up arrow show a few
  other functions such as setting the number of decimal points, swapping items on
  the stack and the use of exponents.
