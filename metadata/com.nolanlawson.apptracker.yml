AutoName: App Tracker
Description: |-
  App Tracker is a productivity app that keeps track of other apps you've used,
  and compiles some useful statistics about them (most used, seldom used, recently
  used, etc.). You can then display this information in a widget or in the app
  itself, and launch them easily.

  Uses logcat to figure out what apps have been launched, which means it may not
  work on Android 4.1+.
