AutoName: App Tracker
Summary: Track your app usage
Description: |-
    App Tracker is a productivity app that keeps track of other apps you’ve used,
    and compiles some useful statistics about them (most used, seldom used, recently
    used, etc.). You can then display this information in a widget or in the app
    itself, and launch them easily.

    Uses logcat to figure out what apps have been launched, which means it may not
    work on Android 4.1+.
