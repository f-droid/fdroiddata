AutoName: Problem Tracker
Summary: Offline problem proficiency tracker with color-coded grid
Description: |
  A minimal offline tool for tracking problem-solving proficiency through color-coded grids.
  
  - No problem content storage, no explanations, no scheduling algorithms
  - Visual proficiency tracking: gray = not attempted, red (light to dark) = needs practice, green = mastered
  - Mark each attempt as correct/incorrect: incorrect deepens red, correct lightens it, light red turns green when correct
  - No account required, no ads, no tracking, fully offline
  
  Perfect for exam prep workflows where you want to focus on solving problems,
  not managing a complex learning system.
