Auto Name:WhereAreTheEyes
Summary:Build a map of surveillance cameras with other activists
Description:
Where are the Eyes is a tool for detecting and evading surveillance. Together,
you and other users build a map of surveillance cameras to protect activists,
students, and other at-risk minorities.

When run, the map will display red pins on cameras near your location. To mark a
new camera, or verify that a marked camera exists, just stand near it and press
the "eye" button.

The app has telemetry on by default. Press "Mapbox" button on the main screen to
disable it.
