AutoName: Voice Recorder Plugin
Description: |-
  Note: As of Conversations 2.2.0 this functionality is integrated in the main app

  This simple voice recorder can be used to send voice messages from within
  Conversations, an XMPP client. It is more straightforward than using Android's
  built-in or the vendor's voice recording UIs.
