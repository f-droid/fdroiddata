Description: |-
    A ball sits in a flat tray containing one or more squares (goals). The challenge
    is to guide the ball around the tray and collect all the squares. Tilt the tray
    to, literally, start the ball rolling. The ball rolls in a straight line until
    it hits a wall, you can then tilt again.
