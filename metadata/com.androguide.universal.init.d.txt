Auto Name:Universal Init.d
Summary:Emulate init.d to run scripts at startup
Description:
Emulates the behavior of the init.d kernel mechanism (automatic execution of
the scripts contained within the /system/etc/init.d folder at each boot).

What makes this method really universal is that everything happens on the app
side, no system files modifications are required whatsoever. The tool
basically emulates the behavior of the init.d kernel mechanism : it will
detect whenever the device is rebooted and execute the scripts located in
/system/etc/init.d.

With this new init.d support granting mechanism comes a new kernel-sided
init.d support detection mechanism, so that your int.d scripts don't get
executed twice, which would only make for a longer boot time. Basically,
when you run the test, it will generate a little init.d script which
creates a file on your sdcard. Then, after you rebooted, it will check
if the file that the generated script creates has indeed been created in
order to determine if your kernel already has init.d support built-in.
If the file was created, it does. If not, it doesn't, as simple as that.

An additionnal functionnality to this tool is the ability to manage, edit,
delete & run your init.d scripts with the touch of a button.
