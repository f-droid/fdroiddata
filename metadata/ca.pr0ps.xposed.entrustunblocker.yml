AutoName: Entrust IdentityGuard Unblocker
Description: |-
  The Entrust IdentityGuard Mobile app refuses to work on devices that are rooted
  or running custom ROM images, calling them "unsecured".

  The validity of that statement notwithstanding, some people need to use the
  application for work. It's not something you choose to install, it's something
  you're forced to install by your IT department.

  In the interest of getting some work done (without buying a new phone), I
  created this Xposed module to bypass the checks for root and custom ROMs.

  Just install, enable, reboot, and you're done. Get back to work.

  Requires the <a href="http://xposed.info">Xposed framework</a>
