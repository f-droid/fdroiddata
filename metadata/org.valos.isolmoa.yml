Description: |-
  Isolmoa is a two-player abstract strategy board game based on the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isola_%28board_game%29">Isola</a> game. It is played
  on a board which is initially filled with squares. Both players have one piece.

  To begin, each player places his/her piece. Next, each turn of play is composed
  of two actions:

  * Moving his/her piece to a neighboring position
  * Removing any square with no piece on it.

  The goal of the game is to block the opponent by destroying all the squares
  which surround him before being blocked yourself.
