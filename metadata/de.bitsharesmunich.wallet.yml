AutoName: BitShares Wallet
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is no longer maintained (its repo was archived).

  Cryptocurrency volatility is now a thing of the past. BitShares' Smartcoins are
  tokens that are market-pegged to individual fiat currencies like the Dollar,
  Euro, Yuan and assets like Businesses, Gold and Oil. Thousands of investors,
  savers, traders and employers now use Smartcoins to buy and sell goods and
  services globally.

  No bank account? No problem. The unbanked and underbanked can now buy, sell and
  use Smartcoins locally with anyone, or utilize one of the many Exchanges who
  will convert your fiat into Smartcoins and back again if needed. CCEDK.com,
  Poloniex, Bittrex, BTC38 and Yunbi just to name a few.

  BitShares itself is not a company, it's a Decentralized Autonomous Community
  (DAC) of friendly FinTech people of all ages wanting freemarket solutions to
  secure life, liberty and property for all. BitShares software uses the Delegated
  Proof Of Stake (DPOS) consensus protocol which cannot be blocked, taken down or
  centralized by asic or quantum computing hardware.
