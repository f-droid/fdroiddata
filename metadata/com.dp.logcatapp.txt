Auto Name:Logcat Reader
Summary:A simple app to view logs
Description:
Logcat Reader makes it easy to view and save the device logs.

'''Features:'''

* Color coded logs based on log priority
* Search through log messages and tags
* Option to select from available log buffers¹
* Save the logs as a simple text file (as you would see via logcat)
* Dark UI theme (switches on at night automatically by default)

¹ May not work on all devices, in which case, the option will simply not be
present in Settings.
