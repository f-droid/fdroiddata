Auto Name:A2DP Volume
Summary:Manage Bluetooth functions
Description:
Automatically adjusts the media volume on connect and resets it on disconnect.
This is done so that stereo streaming audio can work properly.  Intended
primarily for car Bluetooth systems. It can read out text messages using Text
To Speech (TTS) services while you are connected.  Each paired Bluetooth
device or virtual device (home dock, car dock, power connection, or headset
plug) can be configured to your liking.  There is a
[http://code.google.com/p/a2dpvolume/wiki/Manual manual] on the website.

A secondary feature is the ability to capture location information so you can
find where you left your car.  The location can also be automatically captured
when exiting Car Mode on your Android device and read by any app that
understands GPS data.
