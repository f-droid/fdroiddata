Name:LG Touch LED
Summary:LED notifications for LG phones
Description:
For:
* LG Optimus 2X/T-Mobile G2X/Star (P990/P999/SU660)
* LG Optimus Black (P970)
* LG Optimus 3D (P920)
* LG Nitro (P930)
* LG Optimus ME (P350)
* LG Marquee (LS855)
* LG Prada 3.0 (P940)
and possibly others.

This application uses mainly the touch LED buttons to show if there is any missed
notifications by turning them on
and off. Vibrator and notification ringtones are supported. It is enabled by default
and will autostart on boot but has to be run once after installation to start the service.

May require root: it depends on the phone.
