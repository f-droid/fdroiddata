AutoName: Ship Captain and Crew
Description: |-
  A classic dice game for up to four players!

  This simple game requires a lot of luck and a very small amount of skill. In
  times past, this game was used as a gambling or drinking game by sailors and
  merchants alike. You must procure a ship (6), a captain (5), and a crew (4), the
  remainder is your cargo.

  Once you have your ship, captain, and crew, you can click on dice that you wish
  to hold in order to save them rather than roll them. You can also choose to keep
  them all if the conditions are right. The "point" or high score is always
  visible, and that is a big help to the "hammer" or the last player.

  This game is open source and add free! So grab a couple friends and set sail for
  high adventure with this fun little dice game. If your lucky, you may even
  strike "midnight"!
