AutoName: Cooper
Description: |-
  Edit files on your linux machine, even when you're on the go.

  Cooper provides a touch interface for SSH, making it easy to log in to a servers
  and edit files. Make simple code/configuration changes without squinting at a
  tiny terminal and using a special keyboard.

  Cooper does:

  * Allow password based login to SSH servers
  * Let you traverse the directory structure on SSH servers
  * Let you open and edit files on SSH servers
  * Save a list of your SSH servers (for easy access)

  This app is being developed to make remote software/web-app development easier,
  so future improvements will include tablet optimized layouts, a touch optimized
  command execution interface (menu based with support for custom commands), and a
  mechanism for jumping between open files.

  Cooper does not:

  * Allow command execution
  * Provide root/sudo support
  * Save your SSH password
  * Support non-standard SSH ports

  Status: Beta.
