Summary:SMS to internet gateway
Description:
EnvayaSMS can be used to enable any web service to send and receive SMS and 
MMS messages nearly anywhere 
in the world. In particular, it is useful in countries where obtaining a local 
virtual phone number or SMS 
shortcode is difficult, expensive, or impossible. A phone running EnvayaSMS 
connects to the phone network in 
the same way as any other mobile phone, so it can be set up without needing 
approval from anyone else.

EnvayaSMS is designed to to be maintainable even when deployed in remote 
locations that cannot easily be 
accessed by your organization's technical staff. With minimal training, 
non-technical users can do all setup 
and maintenance of deployed phones. The number of SMS' that can be sent is 
capped by Android at 100/hour. 
Expansion pack apks, not yet available from f-droid.org can lift this limit.
