AutoName: Audiometry Made Easy
Description: |-
  <b>Note:</b> this app is no longer actively maintained.

  AME is designed to diagnose hearing loss without the need for expensive medical
  machines. Using signal analysis and your phone or tablet's own microphone, AME
  can calibrate virtually any pair of earphones for a hearing test that will
  return the user's hearing thresholds in dB HL. It also provides services for the
  user to save test results, view them later, and email test results anywhere from
  within the app.
