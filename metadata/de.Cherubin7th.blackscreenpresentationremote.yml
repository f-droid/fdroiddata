AutoName: BlackSCREENremote
Description: |-
  This App can control programs on your computer, like presentations, either by
  using the screen or by using hardware keys. There is no need to have the screen
  on all the time, so the user can switch the screen off and still continue to use
  only the buttons.

  The phone doesn't enter deep sleep, but since the screen is the biggest consumer
  it saves quite a lot of battery and allows for long periods of continuous usage.

  This app works like most remote controls, just download the server on the
  computer and enter the ip address into the app. However, the server is a Java
  jar-file and so no installation is needed and usage is very simple.

  Anti-Feature: Uses a link with advertisement to the download of the server part.
  However, there is an optional direct link without advertisement.
