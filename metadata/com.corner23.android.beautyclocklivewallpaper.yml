AutoName: Beauty Clock
Description: |-
  Bijin Tokei is a genre of wallpaper that is popular in East Asia. Every minute
  the wallpaper changes to a picture of a pretty girl holding an object that
  displays the time.

  This app will download the pictures for every minute from your chosen site
  without caching them <i>but</i> it will check if images already exist in
  <b>sdcard/BeautyClock/pic/site/</b> and the scheme is always aabb.jpg where aa is
  the hour and bb is the minute. In this way, you can have the app display any
  images that you want.
