Summary:Create and share soundboards
Description:
Boarder is an app for creating and managing soundboards - the aural equivalent of a painter's
palette. 

Dropbox support will not work, due to the fact that api keys are not in the source. 
The app is still in beta: internet features are not fully tested and documentation 
is not good. Minor known bugs included.
