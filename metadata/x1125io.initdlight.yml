AutoName: Init.d Light
Description: |-
  This app provides simplest functionality for starting scripts on Android startup
  as root.

  After installing the App, you'll have to run it at least once for the
  BootReceiver to work and for the root access to be granted.

  It will also show you where to place your scripts, which is usually
  "/data/user/0/x1125io.initdlight/files".

  Every script in there will be launched via "su -c [file]".
