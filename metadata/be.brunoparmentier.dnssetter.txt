Auto Name:DNSSetter
Summary:Change DNS servers of your mobile connection
Description:
DNSSetter lets you change your DNS servers. It currently uses the "setprop"
method and works for mobile connections (3G, 4G, etc.). This is temporary and
it will not resist if your IP address changes or if you reboot your device.

As DNS management changes depending on Android version, this might not work
for you. If so, please let me know so I can try adding other methods.

Requires root: Yes. To edit system properties.
