Auto Name:Öffi
Summary:The King of Public Transit
Description:
All-in-one app for public transit:

* trip planner (door to door),
* live departure times (including delays),
* nearby stations (also on a map) and
* interactive network plans.

Öffi makes use of official time table and connection data of the selected public
transit authority! This ensures that disruptions become visible as soon as the
transit authority has included them with the data.

Requested permissions:

* Full network access, because Öffi needs to query information services for departures and disruptions.
* Location, so Öffi can show nearby stations and navigate you from your current location.
* Contacts/Calendar, so Öffi can route you to your contacts or location from a calendar event, store a connection in your calendar or e-mail it to your friends.

Other than that, Öffi will not use your private data.
