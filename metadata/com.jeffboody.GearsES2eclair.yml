AutoName: Gears
Description: |-
  Heavily modified port of the infamous "gears" demo intended to help developers
  learn how to create OpenGL ES programs. While the Linux version is often used as
  sort-of FPS benchmark, this version is very vacuous: On Android the frame rate
  is limited by v-sync (typically 60 FPS) which is the fastest rate that a display
  can refresh the screen. Since Gears is capable of rendering much faster than
  v-sync on most devices it provides limited benchmarking value.
