AutoName: Flashlight
Description: |-
  Uses the LED on your device's camera as a flashlight. If your device does not
  have a camera LED, it will paint a white box on your screen to enable it to
  serve as a poor substitute for a flashlight.

  Requires the Camera permission to control your device's LED but you will notice
  that it does not require the Internet permission as it serves no ads.
