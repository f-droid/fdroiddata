Description: |-
  Uses your camera's LED as a flashlight/torch. Also features a viewfinder using
  the camera so you can see into tight spots that might be blocked by your phone
  as you shine the light.

  Try https://f-droid.org/packages/org.bc_bd.mrwhite if your device doesn't have a camera/flashlight.
