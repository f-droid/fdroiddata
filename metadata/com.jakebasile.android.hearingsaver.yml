AutoName: Hearing Saver
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

  Hearing Saver operates in the background to protect your ears from high volumes
  through bluetooth or analogue headsets. When you first install or update this
  app, you MUST open it at least once!

  After the initial setup, Hearing Saver should work without further input from
  you. To setup the app, open it. You will be presented with the Setup screen. It
  contains a number of controls, and they each interact to allow you to customize
  Hearing Saver's operation. They include defaults for ringers and media, plugging
  and unplugging and to remember last volume.
