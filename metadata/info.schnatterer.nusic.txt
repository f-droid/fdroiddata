Name:nusic
Summary:Informs about new music of artists stored on the device
Description:
nusic uses MusicBrainz - the free music encyclopedia - to find out about new
releases of the artists on your phone. No account necessary.

Please be patient on the first start of the app. It will be faster once
initialized! Note that this app is not optimized for tablets, yet. Please be
patient. This app is open source. It's brought to you for free and is
manufactured by developers in their free time.

If you should encounter any errors or like to have new features, please give us
the opportunity to react before giving a poor rating on Google Play. Please
report any issues by email (this can be done from within the app) or even better
create a ticket [https://github.com/schnatterer/nusic/issues here]. Developers:
You're welcome to contribute, fork us on [https://github.com/schnatterer/nusic
GitHub]. Cheers!
