AutoName: JLyr Lyrics
Description: |-
  You can search for lyrics from a list of lyrics websites without leaving the app
  or go to popular search engines. If you have a Scrobbler like
  https://f-droid.org/packages/net.jjc1138.android.scrobbler or https://f-droid.org/packages/com.adam.aslfms installed then JLyr can
  detect what you are listening to and search for the lyrics automatically. The
  app is also able to detect what the stock Music app (https://f-droid.org/packages/com.android.music) is
  playing, without a Scrobbler.
