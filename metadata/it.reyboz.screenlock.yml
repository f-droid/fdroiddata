AutoName: Lock Screen
Description: |-
  This is not a custom "lock screen", but a shortcut to lock the screen.

  It is very appreciated for all the people who are afraid to destroy the physical
  lock button on their device. Most of them have even a kernel to unlock the phone
  without a physical key, and so with this app they will have their little key
  save for the eternity.

  Features:

  * Google Now gesture!
  * No other silly feature
