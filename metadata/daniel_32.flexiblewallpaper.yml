AutoName: Flexible Wallpaper
Description: |-
  Live wallpaper that allows you to use images with any aspect ratio as a
  wallpaper, instead of being limited to Android's wallpaper requirements. Images
  will scroll all the way from one end to another as you move between home
  screens. Images with a taller aspect ratio than your screen will scroll
  vertically.

  <b>Notes</b>

  Images are loaded at their original resolution, and large images may cause the
  app to run out of memory and crash. Consider reducing the size of large images.

  Some launchers don't scroll the wallpaper all the way to the end when there are
  only a few screens. This is an issue with the launcher itself and there is
  nothing that I can do about it.
