  <b>Support policy</b>

  Let's get the record straight: unless you are using our paid services, we don't owe you anything. The software is provided as is, with no warranty and no guarantee to work with all ill-configured servers/networks on every device with non-stock Android crippled by phone manufacturers.

  We do, however, have great sympathy for any decent person who requires support, and we do try to help. You just have to ask nicely. If you are rude, make demands, feel entitled to premium service or lecture us how to behave, we kindly ask you to uninstall our app and be gone for good.

  <b>Getting support</b>
  * Read <a href="https://xabber.com/faq/">F.A.Q.</a> on our website, you'll be amazed how many issues are already covered!
  * Email is the best way to get tech support. Be nice, and we'll do our best to provide you help. Please, describe your issue in detail. If possible, attach screenshots and debug logs that would help us understand what went wrong.
