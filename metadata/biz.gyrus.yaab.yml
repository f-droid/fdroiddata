Description: |-
    This is a small custom brightness regulator app. The idea is to make screens of
    old devices like HTC Desire dimmer, as dim as possible. Of course HTC Sense on
    Desire has auto brightness feature, but average brightness level set by Sense is
    pretty much higher than needed for comfortable work. For people who use their
    devices for reading books, emails, texting, etc. this kind of application would
    allow to save up to 30% of battery. The website has a full explanation of the
    ideas behind the operation.
