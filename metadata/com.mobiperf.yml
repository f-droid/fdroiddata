AutoName: MobiPerf
Description: |-
  The app uploads 'anonymised' data to the Mobiperf server run by the developers.
  The server is based on free software but the app would need re-coding to work
  with a different server. You can view the data collected that has been collected
  within the app.

  The Android app periodically checks in with the measurement server, running on
  Google App Engine, which sends it a list of measurement tasks to perform.
  Measurement tasks include ping, traceroute, HTTP GET, DNS lookup, and TCP
  Throughput. Each task has an associated set of measurement parameters (e.g.,
  which host to ping), and a schedule (periodicity at which to take the
  measurement).

  The device runs the measurements in the background, and uploads the measurement
  results on its next checkin cycle. By default, devices check in with the server
  every hour. In order to avoid draining the battery, the app will not take any
  measurements if the battery is below a given threshold (80% by default).
