(e.g. from Google Play) won't work with this version and must be removed before installing it.

# Releases are tagged, but according to backends/platform/android/android.mk (which also contains 
# version codes), Market uploads take priority. They may lag notably behind general development, 
# so checking http://sourceforge.net/projects/scummvm/files/scummvm/ is advisable as well.
