Description: |-
    WorldMap is a simple Android app that displays
    [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Physical_Political_World_Map.jpg
    a map] of the world taken from Wikimedia and allows the user to scroll around on
    it. The map is licensed as PD-USGOV; PD-USGOV-CIA-WF - more info
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Physical_Political_World_Map.jpg here])

    The map itself is quite large (6480x3888), so it’s way too big to fit in memory
    all at once (over 48MB). The VM heap size Android supports is either 16 or 24
    megs, so we can’t fit the whole thing in memory at once. To overcome this,
    WorldApp uses the BitmapRegionDecoder API (available as of Android 2.3.3) to
    decode just what it needs to display. The app can also serve as a viewer for
    arbitrary images opened via a (3rd-party) file manager.
