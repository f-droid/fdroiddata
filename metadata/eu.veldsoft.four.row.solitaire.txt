* The Cards in the columns are always visible
* There are four individual cells at the top

Similarities to Solitaire:

* There is a deck and discard pile to draw cards from
* Only Kings may be placed at the top of an empty column
* Cards may be removed from the Ace piles and placed back onto the playing field
* Any number of cards can be moved in one move (as long as they are stacked as in Solitaire

Features unique to this game:

* The four individual cells start with cards in them
* You may only go through the deck twice on draw one and three times on draw three
* The obvious: there are only four columns, not 7 or 8 as in Solitaire and FreeCell, respectively
