Description: |-
    This Android app stores your SSH key phrase and sends it to your PC securely via the LAN when an authorized fingerprint is detected by the Android fingerprint scanner.

    * The PC must run Linux and have FiSSH desktop installed - see [https://gitlab.com/ioanm/fissh-desktop/blob/master/INSTALL.md INSTALL.md here]
    * The PC app then returns the received passphrase to OpenSSH and the standard ssh binary completes the login process.
    * It is important to note that none of the FiSSH apps have access to private key file and that FiSSH uses TLS sockets with certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks!
