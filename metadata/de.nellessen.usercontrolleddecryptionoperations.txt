Summary:Emulates a smart card and lets you control the decryption operations
Description:
This software enables you to transparently encrypt your Dropbox folder on your
PC. It also lets you confirm the decryption operations on an Android smartphone,
which is used as an NFC-enabled token. Additionally, it supports sharing files
with other Dropbox users, while still encrypting the shared data. To really use
the app, you also need to install the encrypting program on your PC. It can be
found in the source code repository.
