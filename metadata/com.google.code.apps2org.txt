Auto Name:Apps2Org
Summary:Organize apps with labels
Description:
Apps2Org is a fork of [[com.google.code.appsorganizer]] which fixes
some usability issues. Apps2Org allows you to organize installed
applications using labels/tags/categories. You can associate labels to
applications, browse thru labeled categories and launch applications -
either using the application or shortcut on your home screen.

Comparing to original application, following changes were made:
* "All labels" shortcut now includes "Other" (uncategorized) apps, so this shortcut completely replaces app launcher and gives access to all of your apps.
* You can easily star/set label for an app directly from shortcut widget, so you can keep your app collection organized "right on the spot" with very little effort.
* Other minor fixes and improvements.
