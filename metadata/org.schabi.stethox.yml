Description: |-
  This is a Xposed Module that enables Stetho for every application on your
  phone. All Stetho functions are given besides Network Monitoring. For this
  however I highly recommend using mitmproxy or tcpdump and Wireshark.

  This Module can be used for Reverse Engineering. Especially the Layout Preview
  is very useful. Please also take a look at Inspackage since this will add even
  more functions for this purpose.

  ATTENTION:Never leave this Module enabled or installed on day to day use. THIS
  IS A SECURITY RISK. Only enable this for Development.
