Description:
Rediscover tourism with WikiJourney!

<a href="https://www.wikijourney.eu/">WikiJourney</a> is an app that allows tourists to
visit a town with Wikipedia information. The app looks around the user for the
points of interest, lists them, then creates a custom trail according to the
user's likes and the time he has.

Features:

* Find POIs around me: the app locates you, and the automatically searches on English Wikipedia the available POIs.
* Map display: once you have been located, the app displays your location with every POIs around you on a map. By tapping one of these points, a bubble displays more information, and links to the Wikipedia article.
* List of POIs: a screen gathers every POIs found by the app, for a fast and easy interaction.
