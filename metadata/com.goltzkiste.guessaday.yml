Description: |-
  A trainer for calculating the day of the week of any given date.

  This app displays a random date and asks you what day of the week that date is.
  Then it checks your answer. Optionally it measures how long it took you. In the
  settings you can configure the range for the random date.

  If you want to learn how to do this calculation, check out on the developer's
  website!
