Summary:Send web pages to your computer
Description:
You will need [[com.google.zxing.client.android]] to be installed to use this.

First visit http://send-to-computer.appspot.com on your computer and make sure
popup blocking is disabled. Scan the barcode given on the screen (the app
remembers the unique id at the end of the url so that it can identify your
requests for web pages). Choose Open in Browser and choose Send to Computer
(you may have to scroll). You are now setup and can send webpages to your
computer via the browser share menu. The computer browser checks every two
minutes for requests so you might have to wait a little. The source code is also
available for the server side of things.
