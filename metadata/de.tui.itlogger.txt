Summary:Measure road quality
Description:
Log and evaluate data from your smartphone and OBD (onboard diagnostics).
iTLogger is the result of a software project at Ilmenau University of
Technology in 2012.
Its aim was to create an app and corresponding desktop
program (in the same code repository), so that people could track their journey
on forest roads and later
evaluate the data on their desktop.
With the logged data you can evaluate the quality of forest roads.
