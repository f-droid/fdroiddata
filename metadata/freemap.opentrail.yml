AutoName: OpenTrail
Description: |-
  OpenStreetMap-based Android app for UK walkers and other countryside users,
  highlighting rights of way and showing contours from OS OpenData. Allows
  both online and offline use. In addition to navigation, walkers may share
  and download footpath issues (blockages, directions etc) and walking
  routes.

  Antifeatures:
  * NonFreeNet: The map data is OpenStreetMap-derived but it is downloaded
  from the Freemap server. OpenTrail does not currently send any personal
  information (such as your Google login) to the Freemap server. All data sent
  is completely anonymous. Location tracking (GPS) is used to find your
  location and to download nearby points of interest from the server. Server
  requests (to find all points of interest close to a given GPS location) are
  logged using standard server (Apache) logging; however they are not
  associated with a username or name.
