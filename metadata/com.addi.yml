AutoName: Addi
Description: |-
  Addi is a mathematical computing environment like Matlab and Octave, but made to
  work on Android devices.

  The goal is for 100% compliance with how Octave works including a compatibility
  mode that makes the behavior more similar to Matlab (already very similar).
