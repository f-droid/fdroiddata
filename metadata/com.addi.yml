AutoName: Addi
Description: |-
    Addi is a mathematical computing environment like Matlab and Octave, but made to
    work on Android devices.

    The goal is for 100% compliance with how Octave works including a compatibility
    mode that makes the behavior more similar to Matlab (already very similar).
