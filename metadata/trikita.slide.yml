AutoName: Slide
Description: |-
  Unlike a typical presentation, only a few words are printed on each slide using
  very large characters. To make up for this, a presenter will use many more
  slides than in a traditional presentation, each slide being shown for a much
  shorter duration.

  The slides use plain text in a visual manner, to help the audience quickly read
  and understand the material. It's said to be helpful with Japanese and other
  eastern languages which use non-Latin alphabets.

  The method is designed for the people who are not good at presentations and who
  are quite nervous about the idea of presenting. This method helps the presenter
  to get organized during the talk and keeps the presenter on track while
  presenting. The method provides clear visual support for the audience and helps
  make the content more memorable.
