Description: |-
  Magia DNI uses the device's camera to read the OCR data on Spanish identity
  cards, calculates its check digit and displays it. It is mostly of interest to
  Spanish people; its purpose is to debunk an urban legend that says that the
  check digit present on the OCR data represents the number of people who are
  named exactly as the card's holder.
