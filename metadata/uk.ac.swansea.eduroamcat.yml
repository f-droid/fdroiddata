Description: |-
  <i>EduroamCAT</i> is an eduroam Configuration Assistant Tool corresponding to
  website https://cat.eduroam.org

  <i>EduroamCAT</i> allows users to configure their device for eduroam wireless
  networks. This tool requires a configuration file from your home
  institution in order acquire the configuration settings needed. These can
  also be discovered by the tool, if the institution has CAT configured. Due
  to limitations in the Android OS, the application needs to set up a screen
  lock if none is already set. The configuration file is in a standardised
  file format and can be obtained from eduroam Configuration Assistant Tool
  deployments (such as https://cat.eduroam.org and others). The tool also
  provides some status information on the eduroam connection.
