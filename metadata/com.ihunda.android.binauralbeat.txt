Auto Name:Binaural Beats Therapy
Summary:Sound to brainwave harmonizer
Description:
Binaural Beats stimulates your brain by sending special auditory artifacts
directly into your headphones to produce subtle changes in behavior through
entrainment of brainwaves frequency. Brain activity operates in waves whose
frequency can be encouraged to change by the sound waves produced in the app.

This app claims to help induce relaxation, creativity and many other desirable
mental states.

The app automatically pauses and resume if a phone call arrives. This is why
PHONE_STATE permissions are required.
