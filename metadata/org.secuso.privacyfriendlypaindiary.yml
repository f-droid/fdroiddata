    Privacy Friendly Pain Diary is an app which can help you track and share your
    pain. It allows you to make daily diary entries recording your condition and the
    intensity, location, nature and time of the pain you feel, as well as the
    medication you take and additional notes. Records of your pain can help health
    professionals gain an insight into the pain you are experiencing.
