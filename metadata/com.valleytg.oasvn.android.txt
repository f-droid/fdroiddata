Summary:Subversion for Android
Description:
Works for http:// https:// and svn:// repositories. svn+ssh:// is experimental and has been added recently.
Currently supports all of the following svn operations: Checkout (Head or specify revision),
Update, Commit, Export (Head or specify revision), Cleanup, and Revert. Also allows you to view remote
repository revisions (you specify the number of revisions to retrieve) and see commit comments, author,
date/time and all files changed, added, deleted, etc.

Working copies and exports of repositories are saved locally (all checked out files will go to your
mountable storage: most of the time /mnt/sdcard/OASVN) so they could be edited on your device with an IDE such as Terminal IDE and then you can commit back to your repository!

The most recent version adds svn export so you can make a local copy of your repository on your Android
device without making a working svn copy. Also the revisions list now prompts for the number of revisions
to retrieve from the remote server. Finally you can checkout or export specific revisions besides the
head version.

The interface has been reworked a bit to include a menu for some functions to clean up the main screen.
Also improved is the German language support. Help is needed  with French, Japanese and
Russian translations: if you can help, there is more information at these links:

Every precaution has been taken to ensure this works correctly, but please make sure to back up your
repositories regularly!

This project is only a couple of months old now and has been growing quickly. A
[http://www.valleytg.com/jira JIRA] has been created to help keep the project moving along.
svn+ssl is still experimental: please send any feedback using the Jira.
