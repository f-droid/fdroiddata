Auto Name:Wa-Tor
Summary:A simple population dynamics simulator
Description:
Wa-Tor simulates a torus (or donut shaped) world with two species: shark and
fish. The fish happily reproduce while the shark need to eat fish to survive.

Wa-Tor was devised by Alexander Keewatin Dewdney and originally presented in the
December 1984 issue of Scientific American.

Maintainer Notes:
The project automatically calculates the version code from the
last tag (see "git describe --tags --dirty"). The tag format
is "v<major>.<minor>". The generated version code is calculated as:
   (major * 1000 + minor) * 1000 + addlCommits * 2 + dirty
where "addlCommits" is the number of commits since the tag.
"dirty" is 1 if there are uncommitted changes.

Since fdroid patches the build.gradle file "dirty" would always
be 1 (not desired), so the prebuild command patches the
build.gradle file to ignore the "dirty" status.

The "preBuild" task should output the versionCode and
versionName.
