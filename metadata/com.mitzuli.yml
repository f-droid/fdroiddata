Description: |-
  Translator featuring a full offline mode, voice input (ASR), camera input (OCR),
  voice output (TTS), and more!

  * VOICE INPUT (ASR): Tired of using a keyboard? Simply talk to your phone and Mitzuli will translate what you say!
  * CAMERA INPUT (OCR): Want to translate a sign, a menu or a newspaper? Take a picture of it and let Mitzuli do its work!
  * VOICE OUTPUT (TTS): Don't know how to pronounce that foreign text? No problem, Mitzuli can speak for you!
  * OVER 50 TRANSLATION DIRECTIONS: We believe that every language should have its place in this world, and this is why we focus on less resourced languages that are often left behind in commercially oriented products. Mitzuli supports Afrikaans, Aragonese, Asturian, Basque, Catalan, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, French, Galician, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Malay, Occitan, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish and Urdu, and we are working hard to get even more!
  * FULL OFFLINE MODE: We know that machine translation comes really handy when you travel abroad. Roaming charges don't. That's not a problem anymore for Mitzuli, which can work even without Internet access. And, unlike other translators, its offline mode offers the same translation quality as the online mode, and advanced features like camera input are also available on it!

  This app periodically updates the list of available languages and their
  respective resources in the background. This is necessary for the app to work
  robustly, and no personal information is sent to the server.

MaintainerNotes: |-
  1.0.3 can be build using ABI splits, however all ABIs are built on each run,
  splitting and packaging is done afterwards. They are disabled in favor of a
  universal apk for now. Once we turned splits on, there is no going back due
  to splits having much higher vercodes. Sample recipe:

  other gradle-splits: armeabi-v7a mips x86
