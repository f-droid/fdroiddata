Description: |-
    ''Sweet IPFS'' is forked from [[org.ligi.ipfsdroid]], which was
    experimental. This app is currently in beta stage, not all features are
    implemented, but the most important is. Feel free to test it and review it.
    If you find a bug or have problems with this app, you can contact me with
    the email provided on the GitHub page.

    ''Sweet IPFS'' targets end-users and developers in order to make IPFS (and
    decentralization) an everyday standard. Its main goal is to be used as a
    file sharing app. For that, it provides a file chooser, QR codes, and a
    browser. To go even faster, you can upload a file or a text directly from
    any app by simply sharing it and choosing ''Sweet IPFS''.

    At the current point, battery and network usage depends a lot on your phone
    and your Android version, and may be high. I am working on this in order to
    provide the best experience and an everyday usage.
