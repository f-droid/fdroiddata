AutoName: Post Writer
Description: |
  Post Writer is a writing app for the true minimalist. Just write, distraction free. When you are done, press the submit button to save and clear.
  Where did your text go? Don't worry! You can always find your saved files in Documents > Posts, but you'll have to use another app for that.
  The whole point of this app is to keep you writing. So leave the past behind and keep typing!
  P.S. Are you writing late at night? Your tired eyes will appreciate the Dark Theme! Hold the submit button to switch between themes.
