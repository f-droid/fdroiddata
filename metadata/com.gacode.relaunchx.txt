Auto Name:ReLaunchX
Summary:Launcher for eInk/eBook devices
Description:
Monochrome Launcher primarily intended for eInk and eBook devices. Can work as a
system launcher or a normal app. Includes file manager, text file viewer, editor
and some system functionality. It is a fork of [[com.harasoft.relaunch]] project
rebranded to avoid confusion. Tested on and developed for Onyx Boox Max, but
many other e-readers are supported as well. Discussion goes on the forum
