Summary:Note taker
Description:
A note taking application. A port of the popular desktop application Tomboy.

The new beta releases of 0.7.0+ have a lot of new features including editing
support, but take care
if you are syncing important notes by making local backup to the sdcard. See
the website for a full list of the new features. The source code
for these builds is in the [https://launchpad.net/tomdroid trunk branch],
while that for the stable versions is in the stable branch.

Maintainer Notes:
0.7.1 and 0.7.2 were previously built from a different branch (lp:tomdroid)
which was then switched away from in favour of lp:tomdroid/stable, so although
we have the binaries built, the build data (commented out) doesn't work for
them.
