Description:
Today’s technology already allow drivers to be guided by a GPS. To take this a step further, this app provides a system to monitor and analyze the driving quality by using the accelerometer (G-sensor) of your smartphone. This will help you determine if the driving is good or bad, helping you improving your own driving skills. Hence the name “Driving Skill Monitor” (DriSMo).

The goal of this application is to emphasize the attention towards good driving quality and make the drivers aware of their own driving quality. By raising the awareness of driving quality, you can increase the quality of driving. Fuel efficiency will also be improved, as a result.
