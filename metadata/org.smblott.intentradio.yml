AutoName: IntentRadio
Description: |-
  Intent Radio is an android internet radio app without a graphical user
  interface. It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of broadcast
  intents. If you do not know what a broadcast intent is, then this is probably
  not the app for you.

  Intent Radio was written primarily to be driven by shortcuts, tasks and events
  triggered from other apps.

  Despite its name, Intent Radio will happily play any audio media supported
  natively by Android, including local content.

  <b>Important:</b> You must run the app manually at least once before Android will
  deliver broadcast intents. This is an Android security feature. Thereafter, even
  after reboots, it should not be necessary to run the app at all.
