Maintainer Notes:
Don't build until reproducible.

The version code and name is in app/build.gradle
Android version code is an integer. So we have 31 bits.
MAJOR         4 bits 0-15
MINOR         8 bits 0-255
RELEASE       8 bits 0-255
ROUTERBUILD   7 bits 0-127
ANDROIDBUILD  4 bits 0-15
See custom_rules.xml for more info.

Increment build number with 'ant incrementBuild' for updates between router releases. (see ./custom_rules.xml)
