AutoName: VDR-Manager
Description: |-
  If you have a VDR at home reachable over the internet and own a mobile phone
  running Android then you possibly find this program useful. Using it you can
  view the EPG and stream live TV to your device.

  VDR-Manager has two parts:

  * The Android application for the user interface
  * A VDR plugin to communicate with. Standard SVDRP is not used because this leads to much more traffic.

  Here the some features

  * list the EPG filtered by time or channel
  * show EPG details
  * search EPG for some simple text
  * list, modify, delete or (de)activate timers
  * create timers from EPG events
  * remote wakeup VDR host using HTTP requests
  * live tv
