AutoName: Debian Kit
Description: |-
  It's possible to install a complete GNU/Linux software stack on Android devices,
  e.g. by adding a chroot environment as others already have implemented. This kit
  does 2 things differently: Firstly, it installs a Debian file system
  side-by-side to the Android file system. In order to access anything that's
  accessible from Android also from the Debian side. And secondly, the Debian
  bootstrap is executed on the Device itself without any help of a larger PC,
  Android debugging bridge or similar.
