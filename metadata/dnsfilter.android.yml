AutoName: DNSfilter
Description: |-
    ''personalDNSfilter'' is a DNS filter proxy written in Java. It hooks into
    the domain name (DNS) resolution and returns the loopback address for
    filtered hosts.

    It can be used for filtering ads and other unwished hosts based on a host
    list – thus it is a good AdBlock alternative. On Android 4.2 and newer it
    can be used as effective ad, malware and tracking server filter without
    root access!

    It works with any upstream DNS server - filtering is completely local - no
    phoning home or such things! You can run it locally on your device or
    centrally as DNS server in your network.
