AutoName: ChartDroid Core
Description: |-
  You don't need to install this unless another app needs it. ChartDroid is an
  Intent-based "library application" for static chart and graph generation on
  Android. Other applications can use it to graph/plot/display numerical data in
  many representations by implementing a ContentProvider according to this simple
  [specification](https://code.google.com/archive/p/chartdroid/wikis/InterfaceSpecification.wiki).

  ChartDroid is consistent with the "Unix toolkit" philosophy of building small,
  interoperable tools. Having ChartDroid exist as an independent application
  (as against being an importable .jars library) conserves storage space and
  eliminates redundant code.
