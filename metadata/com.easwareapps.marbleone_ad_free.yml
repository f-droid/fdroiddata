AutoName: Marble One
Description: |-
    How to play:

    1. Find two marbles and an empty location lying together along a line -- that is
    "marble-marble-empty" or "empty -marble-marble". This pattern can be in
    horizontal or vertical direction.

    2. Select the marble away from the empty location. Then select the empty
    location. The selected marble will jump over the adjacent one to the empty
    location: now the pattern will be "empty-empty-marble" or "marble-empty-empty".
    The middle marble gets removed by this. Similarly, go on removing the marbles
    one by one till you reach a state when there are no two marbles together with an
    adjacent vacant position.
