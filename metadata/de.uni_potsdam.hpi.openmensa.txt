Auto Name:OpenMensa
Summary:Meals for university canteens
Description:
OpenMensa shows you what you can eat in the cafeteria or canteen at your
university. At the moment about 150 canteens in German speaking countries are
supported. In order to get today's meal plan, this app connects to the
database at [http://openmensa.org http://openmensa.org].

Anti-feature:NonFreeNet. It seems that the on-line database server is to be
open-sourced sometime in the near future, although currently it is still not.

Status: BETA.
