AutoName: Wa-Tor
Description: |-
    Wa-Tor simulates a torus (or donut shaped) world with two species: shark and
    fish. The fish happily reproduce while the shark need to eat fish to survive.

    Wa-Tor was devised by Alexander Keewatin Dewdney and originally presented in the
    December 1984 issue of Scientific American.

MaintainerNotes: |-
    The project automatically calculates the version code from the
    last tag (see "git describe --tags --dirty"). The tag format
    is "v<major>.<minor>". The generated version code is calculated as:
       (major * 1000 + minor) * 1000 + addlCommits * 2 + dirty
    where "addlCommits" is the number of commits since the tag.
    "dirty" is 1 if there are uncommitted changes.

    Since fdroid patches the build.gradle file "dirty" would always
    be 1 (not desired), so the prebuild command patches the
    build.gradle file to ignore the "dirty" status.

    The "preBuild" task should output the versionCode and
    versionName.
