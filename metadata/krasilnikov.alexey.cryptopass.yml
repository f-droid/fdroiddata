Description: |-
    Generate different passwords from single master password using cryptographically
    strong method (PBKDF2 with SHA-256).

    Create strong passwords for different websites (or anything else) using a single
    secret key. There's no need to remember or store multiple passwords if you can
    derive them from your master key.

    Сan easily be used as password generator and password manager.

    Your passwords doesn't store anywhere, username and url pairs stored for easy
    access.

    password = base64(pbkdf2(secret, username@url))

    PBKDF2 uses SHA-256 and 5000 iterations. Cuts password to specified length (25
    by default).
