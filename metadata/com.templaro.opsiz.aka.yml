Description: |-
  This project enables ham radio operators to use their android phones as memory
  keyers to send CW or Hellschreiber signals using any radio transmitter capable
  of putting out a carrier wave. The application presents a list of editable
  phrases, then plays the selected phrase as morse code (or Hellschriber) through
  the sound output. The audible tones produced may be used directly if a modulated
  signal is desired, but the sound can also be routed through an easy-to-build
  interface which converts this sound into on/off keying for the transmitter.
