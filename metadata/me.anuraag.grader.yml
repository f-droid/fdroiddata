Description: |-
  Allows students to simply and easily track their grades. Create classes and add
  grades for each of those classes. Each grade is created with a name and the
  point value it holds. With this you can calculate the percentage and overall
  grade for each class. Gradr also allows students to automatically predict how
  many points they need on their next assignment to get the grade that they
  desire.
