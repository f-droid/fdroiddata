  Unlike upstream build, this one has all plugins bundled together in single apk.
  External plugin apks (e.g. from Google Play) won't work with this version and
  must be removed before installing it.

MaintainerNotes: |-
  Releases are tagged, but according to backends/platform/android/android.mk (which also contains
  version codes -- however, it hasn't been raised in a while), Market uploads take priority. They
  may lag notably behind general development, so checking https://sourceforge.net/projects/scummvm/files/scummvm/
  is advisable as well.
