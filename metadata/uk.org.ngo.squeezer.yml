AutoName: Squeezer
Description: |-
    Control your SqueezeCenter ("Slimserver") and Squeezebox (or multiple
    squeezeboxes) from your Android gadget.

    * Now playing, artwork, seeking within tracks, volume control
    * Browse the library by artist, album, song title, genre, year, or playlist
    * Browse the music folders (if supported by the server)
    * Full library search
    * Internet radio support (browse, staff picks, search)
    * Scan the local network for compatible Squeezeservers

    The Google Analytics library was replaced with a dummy library, so no usage
    statistics will be sent even though there is a switch enabled in the
    Preferences.

MaintainerNotes: |-
    Includes both, Crashlytics and Google Analytics. Tags are un-
    reliable since UCM reads the beta tag, not the live (~= release)
    tag.
