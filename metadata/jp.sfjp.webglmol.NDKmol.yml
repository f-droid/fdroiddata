Description: |-
  You can view three dimensional structures of proteins and small molecules.
  NDKmol supports most of common representations for molecules, such as ribbon,
  trace, stick, sphere and line. NDKmol also supports symmetry operations;
  biological assemblies and crystal packing can be displayed. When launched,
  NDKMol loads porin as an example: use your fingers to rotate the view. Search
  for other molecules or load pdb files via the sdcard
