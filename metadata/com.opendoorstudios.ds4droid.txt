Summary:Nintendo DS emulator
Description:
nds4droid is a free, open source Nintendo DS emulator for Android based
on DeSmuME. It is currently in it's infancy but does support most of the
features one would expect in an emulator.

Unlike official version this build does not support support RAR archives,
because of legal reasons.
