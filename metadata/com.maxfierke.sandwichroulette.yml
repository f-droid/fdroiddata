AutoName: SandwichRoulette
Description: |-
  SandwichRoulette is an application designed for the indecisive. Like many
  people, my lunch has been delayed because of my inability to decide on what to
  put in my sandwiches. This application, designed for Android-powered devices
  running 2.1 and higher, automates the ingredient choosing process. Creations can
  be saved and later versions will support sharing the particularly delicious
  ones.
