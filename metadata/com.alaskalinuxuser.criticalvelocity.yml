AutoName: Critical Velocity
Description: |-
  Captain! The planet is collapsing! We have to get out of this tunnel, but we've
  been hit! Our thrusters are failing....

  So begins your journey back to the surface! Watch out for barriers and obstacles
  in this open source side scrolling arcade style game! Once you reach 25000
  points, you will find the exit to the surface and save the lives of your crew,
  but after passing each obstacle, your vessel picks up speed, making the journey
  more difficult! Can you make it, Captain?
