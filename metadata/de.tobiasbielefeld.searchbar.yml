AutoName: Simple Search
Description: |-
  A very basic app designed for people who want to use a search widget with their
  preferred search engine.

  This app contains a search bar to type in a search query, which will be opened
  in the Internet browser. A widget for the home screen will simply start the app.

  You can change the search engine in the settings (Default is DuckDuckGo) or type
  in a custom search string. The app also saves the search queries as a history.
