Description: |-
  Note: The app is no longer developed, superseded by https://f-droid.org/packages/com.sapuseven.untis/

  An alternative FLOSS Android client for the Untis timetable system.

  Untis is a proprietary timetable software. More information about Untis can be
  found at https://untis.at. To use Untis, your school must provide it. Your
  school must also give you an account with which you can access your current
  timetable. Why use this app when there is an official one? The official app is
  also proprietary and includes libraries from google and other tracking software.
  OpenUntis offers you exactly the same features and even more. Free choice of
  themes and dark mode are of course also included.

  OpenUntis is a fork of BetterUntis, we removed proprietary libraries and some
  unnecessary requests to other non-free networks.

  WebUntis is a non-free network.
