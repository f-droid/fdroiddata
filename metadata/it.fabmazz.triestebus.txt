Auto Name:TriesteinBus
Summary:Arrival times for Trieste public transport
Description:
This app is useful for finding waiting times for the bus stops in Trieste
(Italy). It is in heavy development, and this first build is an alpha release.

At the moment the only thing it can do is finding the arrival times by the bus
stop id. Unfortunately, this is quite unconfortable because these are usually
codes found by the bus stop (e.g. FER-D5020), but then the arrival times are
displayed nicely.
