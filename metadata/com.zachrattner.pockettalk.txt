Auto Name:Pocket Talk
Summary:Read text messages using your sense of touch
Description:
You're driving down the highway when a text message comes in. Your phone's in
your pocket, so what do you do? Risk your life as well as the lives of the
others around you as you fish around in your pocket, or read the message with
your thigh as your phone vibrates the contents of the message in International
Morse Code? Be sure to turn vibration on though, as the default setting just
reads texts out loud.
