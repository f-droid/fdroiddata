AutoName: LTE Cleaner
Description: |-
    Tired of the abundance of phone cleaners on the play store? Tired of them being
    extremely shady? Tired of them doing nothing? Tired of ads? Tired of having to
    pay? Me too.

    Android API 23+ (Marshmallow) no longer allows apps to clean other app's caches,
    thus the claim of cleaners clearing them is completely false.

    The only thing they can clean: log files, temporary files, and empty folders.
    All three ''LTE Cleaner'' wipes.

    ''LTE Cleaner'' is %100 free, open source, ad free, and deletes everything it
    claims too.
