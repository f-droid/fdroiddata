AutoName: Rehearsal Assistant
Description: |-
    A voice / sound recording utility with two modes of operation:

    Session Mode: organizes recordings into sessions, and time-stamps relative to
    the beginning of the session, making it useful for recording your thoughts and
    observations during an event.

    If you are a choreographer or director watching a rehearsal of your work, this
    can help you make note of the feedback you want to share with the cast.

    Simple Mode: easy recording and playback of sound files. If you are a musician
    or writer, it can help you record and remember your spontaneous moments of
    inspiration.

    Also works great for shopping lists and other kinds of reminders.
