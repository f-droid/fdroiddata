AutoName: aSQLiteManager
Description: |-
  Front end allowing management of SQLite databases. These are very commonly used
  by apps to store settings in the /data directory, but you would need root access
  to move them to a location that this app can edit them from. If you try to enter
  that directory with this app's file manager it suggests you install aShell to do
  it directly, but we don't have that in the repo as the source code is not yet
  available.
