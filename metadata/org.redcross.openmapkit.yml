AutoName: OpenMapKit
Description: |-
  OpenMapKit (OMK) is an extension of OpenDataKit allowing users to create
  professional quality mobile data collection surveys for field data collection.

  OpenMapKit launches directly from OpenDataKit when the OSM question type is
  enabled in a standard survey. Simply include OSM questions and tags in your
  survey to collect information on OSM in the field.

  Traditional field data collection tools for OpenStreetMap have either relied on
  paper or are too complicated, targeted at GIS professionals, or lack an
  understanding of traditional survey techniques. As new projects such as
  <a href="http://www.missingmaps.org/">Missing Maps</a> and other humanitarian field data
  collection projects focus on field data collection the need for a structured,
  yet simple, OpenStreetMap field data collection tool became apparent. OpenMapKit
  serves this need.

  * View OpenStreetMap tiles via web and pre-cached mbtiles.
  * Download OSM data from the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API">Overpass API</a> for offline use.
  * Create and update tags for OSM features.
  * Integration with <a href="https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/">ODK Collect</a>.
