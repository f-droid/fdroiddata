Summary: Isolate your Big Brother apps
Description: |-
    Insular is a FLOSS fork of Island.
    With Insular, you can:<ul>
    <li>Isolate app, for privacy protection.</li>
    <li>Clone app, for parallel running.</li>
    <li>Freeze app, to completely block its background behaviors.</li>
    <li>Hide app, for various reasons.</li>
    <li>Archive app, for potential future use on-demand.</li>
    <li>Use VPN only on one side, or different VPN on both sides.</li>
    <li>Prohibit USB access</li></ul>
    If your device is incompatible or not encrypted, you can skip this limitation manually. Please refer to <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/-t3366295">the XDA post</a> for details.
    To uninstall and remove Insular completely, please first "Destroy Insular" in Settings - Setup - Click the recycle-bin icon besides Insular. If you have already uninstalled Insular app, please "Remove work profile" in your device "Settings - Accounts".

    <b>PERMISSIONS</b><ul>
    <li>DEVICE-ADMIN: Device administrator privilege is required to create the Insular space (work profile), which serves as the fundamental functionality of Insular. It will be explicitly requested for your consent.</li>
    <li>PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS: Required to correctly recognize the running state of apps. It will be explicitly requested for your consent.</li></ul>
    We will never collect any data and Insular has no Internet permission. Please read our privacy policy for more details.

    <b>Differences from Island</b><ul>
    <li>all blobs (gms, crashlytics, etc) are removed to comply with F-droid's policy</li>
    <li>Internet access for this app is removed because we just don't need it</li>
