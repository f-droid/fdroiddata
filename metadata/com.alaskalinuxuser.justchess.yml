Description: |-
    Play chess against a very simple author written chess engine, or against  a
    friend in pass and play mode.

    Simple features include:

    * One or Two player
    * Move suggestion
    * Piece move highlighting
    * A 3 ply open source chess engine written by the author

    This game is not hard to beat. It was a learning curve to create a chess engine,
    but is playable, and supports two players in a pass and play fashion. All of the
    material is available for use from the source files.
