Summary:Track your app usage
Description:
App Tracker is a productivity app that keeps track of other apps you’ve used, and compiles some useful 
statistics about them (most used, seldom used, recently used, etc.). You can then display this information 
in a widget or in the app itself, and launch them easily.

Uses Logcat to figure out what apps have been launched.
