AutoName: Gmote
Description: |-
  Gmote turns Android into a remote control for a computer, allowing users to run
  movies and music at a distance. It supports all of the standard remote control
  features such as play, pause, rewind, volume controls etc. It also has a
  built-in file browser that lets you select what to play. Some typical use-cases
  are people launching and controlling movies while sitting back on their couch,
  or listening to music.

  It also has a touch pad feature which allows you to control your mouse from the
  phone, similar to a laptop touchpad (also sending keystrokes typed in on the
  phone to the computer). It's great for sitting back on the couch while watching
  youtube or hulu.
