Description: |
    Have you ever watched one of those adventure movies where
    people are fighting on a rickety rope bridge? As they move,
    more and more of the bridge breaks and falls beneath them...
    Well, in those scenes, I found the inspiration for a board
    game! Players take turns moving and attacking each other on
    a more and more dangerous board!
