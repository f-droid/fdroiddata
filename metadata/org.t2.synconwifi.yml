AutoName: SyncOnWifi
Description: |-
  Ever had an account on your android device that you want to sync only when
  you're at home? Ever wished you could have your work email stop synchronising
  when you leave the office? SyncOnWifi handles this for you. It automatically
  switches synchronisation of your account on or off, depending on the WiFi
  network you are connected to.

  The following permission are required:

  * WiFi / network status to react to WiFi network connecting / disconnecting.
  * Contacts / Accounts access to read which accounts there are on your device. NO contact data is accessed.
  * Read / Write synchronisation settings to allow automatic synchronisation switching.
