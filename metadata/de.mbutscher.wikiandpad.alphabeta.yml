Name: WikiAndPad
AutoName: WikiAndPad alpha/beta
Description: |-
  WikidPad is a Wiki-like notebook for storing your thoughts, ideas, todo lists,
  contacts, or anything else you can think of to write down. It is also available
  for Windows (binary installer) and Linux and Mac OS (as Python source). You can
  clip snippets from a browser, syntax-highlight wiki words and search notes.

  This app is in the early stages of development so is considered alpha.

  WikidAndPad uses text files indexed by a database stored on your sdcard, but it
  is currently not possible to create the database from within the app. First, you
  must create the database of the type Original Sqlite within WikidPad on the
  desktop and copy it to your sdcard.
