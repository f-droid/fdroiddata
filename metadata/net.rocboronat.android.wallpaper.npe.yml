AutoName: Null Black Wallpaper
Description: |-
    Use a blank pattern as "live wallpaper".

    A black wallpaper for battery and performance tweakers! It saves your
    battery by two ways:

    * The best screens doesn’t need energy to paint black pixels
    * This live wallpaper actually does nothing. Nothing is nothing. Not "loading a black image". The back it’s blank, so your CPU will be thinking in other things, increasing your phone performance and decreasing the battery drain.
