Auto Name:Superuser
Summary:Manage root access
Description:
An app to allow or forbid apps' requests to run as root. The entire app can be
built from source with the Android SDK and NDK, including the '''su''' binary
which is bundled within and copied to /system when the prompts are followed.

You must already have root for this to work, because it leverages the existing
su and Superuser app to install itself. However, if you know what you are doing
you can use this apk as a su/Superuser substitute if you are gaining an initial
root. Once the install is completed you can disable or remove the old app.

Up to version 1.0.3.0 this might not work on Android 5.0+.
