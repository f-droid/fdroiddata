AutoName: Bluez IME
Description: |-
  This application installs a new IME (soft-keyboard) that can read data from a
  Bluetooth input device. Among the supported devices are: Zeemote JS1, MSI
  Chainpus BGP100, Phonejoy and iControlPad (iCP).

  This is NOT a bluetooth keyboard driver, it ONLY supports the devices listed
  above.

  Analog input is supported but requires that the app you are using BluezIME with
  also supports it.

  Some of the major emulators support BluezIME analog input, setup your controller
  inside the emulator app instead of through the BluezIME interface if possible.

  If your favorite app does not support BluezIME analog input, please write the
  publishers and ask for it!

  Confirmed to work with almost all devices from HTC, Samsung and Motorola.

  Reported NOT working with any LG device with stock ROM:
