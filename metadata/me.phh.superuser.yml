AutoName: Superuser
Description: |-
  An app to allow or forbid apps' requests to run as root. Note that this app
  doesn't include the <b>su</b> binary, so your device must already be rooted.

  You must already have root for this to work, because it leverages the existing
  su and Superuser app to install itself. However, if you know what you are doing
  you can use this apk as a su/Superuser substitute if you are gaining an initial
  root. Once the install is completed you can disable or remove the old app.

  This is a fork of https://f-droid.org/packages/com.koushikdutta.superuser with further updates and
  support for newer devices.
