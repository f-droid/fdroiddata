AutoName: Concentric Clock
Description: |-
  This is a clock that uses spinning and growing concentric arcs to tell the time,
  and demonstrates in a dynamic way the factors of 60. The minute hand is
  suggested by the start and end positions of the arcs, while the hour of day is
  shown by the size of the outer arc.
