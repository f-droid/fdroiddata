AutoName: Tomdroid
Description: |-
    A note taking application. A port of the popular desktop application Tomboy.

    The new beta releases of 0.7.0+ have a lot of new features including editing
    support, but take care if you are syncing important notes by making local backup
    to the sdcard. See the website for a full list of the new features. The source
    code for these builds is in the [https://launchpad.net/tomdroid trunk branch],
    while that for the stable versions is in the stable branch.

MaintainerNotes: |-
    0.7.1 and 0.7.2 were previously built from a different branch (lp:tomdroid)
    which was then switched away from in favour of lp:tomdroid/stable, so although
    we have the binaries built, the build data (commented out) doesn't work for
    them.
