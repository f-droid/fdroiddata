Description: |-
    NetTTS allows to use Android device as remote-controlled Text-to-Speech server
    from other computers, via simple telnet-like network protocol. A TTS engine must
    be installed on your device. To try:

    telnet <IP address of device> 4444

    type "Hello".

    Note that currently app provides minimal means of access control (optional
    plain-text password), so use outside your local network with caution.
