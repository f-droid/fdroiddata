AutoName: Bushido Blocks
Summary: Block-matching game
Description: |-
    Test your skills and master the way of the Samurai in this fast-paced and
    addictive Bejeweled-style puzzle game!

    Tap matches of three or more blocks to slice them with your katana.

    The more blocks you can slice in one go, the more time you gain in a race
    against the clock.

    Special blocks eliminate whole rows of blocks but don't give you any extra time,
    so use them wisely!

    Proprietary leaderboard and ad libraries were removed.

    We used a different library version of libgdx to that used in the source code
    so, as always, any problems could be due to the f-droid build process.
