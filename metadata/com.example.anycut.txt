Auto Name:Any Cut
Summary:Create shortcuts for anything
Description:
You can make shortcuts for anything that has an activity e.g Android keyboard
settings screen.
All activities
are listed but there is no description of what each does, so you'll just have
to take a guess and some
may not do anything.
In addition you can make shortcuts to directly dial or send an sms to a contact.

This app is ancient so it may not work on Android 4+ but you can get direct
access to app activities
with [[com.ideasfrombrain.search_based_launcher_v2]].
