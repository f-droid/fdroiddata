Description: |
    Vitosha Poker Odds is a Monte Carlo based Texas Holdem calculator.

    Texas Holdem is the most popular poker game. In its nature it is
    a skill based gambling game. Playing strategy consists of two
    components - hand strength and risk taking. The risk taking
    component should be handled by the player itself, but hand
    strength can be calculated with electronic device. The analytical
    calculation of the hand strength is possible, but sometimes it is
    too complicated. In such cases Monte-Carlo based calculators are
    very useful. The calculator plays many games with the given hand
    and it calculates the chances to win. Because it is a statistical
    tool it is not 100% reliable. It should be used wisely and
    carefully.
