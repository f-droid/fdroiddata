AutoName: DSC Auto Rename
Description: |-
  Automatically change the name of images files taken by the camera based on the
  date and time when the file was created.

  <b>Renamed and moved files process cannot be rolled back! Use this software with
  caution!</b>

  The application does not store the old names because will cause conflicts: the
  default camera application use a counter which is reset each time when files are
  removed/renamed. As a workaround can be selected the option "Append original
  name".
