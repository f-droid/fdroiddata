Auto Name:Hydra Slayer
Summary:Adventure game
Description:
Hydra Slayer is a roguelike game where combat has been inspired by some
mathematical puzzles about brave heroes slaying many headed beasts. 
This might look like a standard dungeon crawler, but the puzzle element 
is important, and the later game is meant to be challenging. 

The character can be controlled by touching part of the screen to indicate
direction, but bear in mind that walls can't be traversed!

* In most menus, you can touch a menu item to activate it; most actions can be also selected by pressing the Menu button.
* On the race selection screen, click on the top part of the screen or use D-pad to change race, and then touch the middle of the screen to play the chosen race.
* On the game screen, touch the corner which contains the list of your weapons to switch weapons, and touching the corner opens a single menu including all possible actions.
* Since this is based on a desktop game, most common actions can be also executed by pressing hardware buttons.
* In questions, touching the top of the screen means yes and the bottom of the screen means no.
