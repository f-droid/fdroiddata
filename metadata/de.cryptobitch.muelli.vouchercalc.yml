AutoName: Voucher Calc
Summary: Calculates how many vouchers you need to use
Description: |-
    If you receive vouchers (from, say, sodexo) which have a fixed value and you
    need to pay a certain amount, you may wonder how many vouchers you have to spend
    and how much tip you may be giving with an additional voucher.

    Features:

    * Enter price you need to pay
    * Select the maximum number of vouchers you carry
    * It shows how much you still have to pay
    * Or how much extra you’d give with an additional voucher
