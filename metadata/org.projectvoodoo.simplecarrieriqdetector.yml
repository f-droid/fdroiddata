AutoName: Voodoo CarrierIQ Detector
Description: |-
    This is a naive app that tells if your phone seems to host CarrierIQ elements or
    not.  CarrierIQ is a diagnostics tool that comes embedded in the firmware of
    some Android phones.

    Some malware scanners are falsely reporting this as the AndroidOS/Qicsomos.A
    trojan.  That trojan requires the android.permission.SEND_SMS permission, this
    app does not, so it cannot send SMS messages.
