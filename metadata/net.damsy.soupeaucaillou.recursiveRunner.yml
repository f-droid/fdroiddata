AutoName: Recursive Runner
Description: |-
  Sure, except there is a running and jumping obstacle to avoid: You! (and You
  (and You (and You (and...))))

  Experience an all new kind of running game!

  Used to play until being hit by an obstacle? You'll play for 90 seconds each
  game.

  Used to control 1 running hero? We'll give you 10 of them. The trick? You
  control them one at a time, and when you're done with one, he will do the same
  run over and over and continue to score points for you.

  The challenge is to score with your current hero while avoiding your previous
  ones - if you hit one of them he will disappear forever.
